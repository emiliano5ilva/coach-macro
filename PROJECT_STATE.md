_Last updated: 2026-06-30 — **NUTRITION DETAIL + TODAY-TAB FOOD-LOG PARITY ✅ SHIPPED** (`a0830a3`, bundle `NativeApp-0843cb18`). **Shared `src/NutritionDetail.jsx`** component: macro **ring** (P-red/C-blue/F-amber split by calorie contribution, calories centered) + box-styled **"Nutrition"** label (P/C/F dots + grams) + **share-of-today's-target** bars (entry/meal total ÷ `macros` day target); 4 stored macros only (cal/P/C/F); works for a single food OR a whole meal (combined totals + "In this meal" per-food list, each drillable). **Fuel-tab** (`fuel.jsx`): logged entries tappable → detail (inline impl, predates the shared component — could dedupe to `NutritionDetail.jsx` later); **"Meal plan outdated" banner reskinned** (dropped `//`+DM-Mono → Archivo eyebrow + stadium pills). **Today-tab** (`ob_screens2.jsx`): **food-icon emojis** on every log row (`getFoodIcon`/iconMap); **tap food row** → single-food detail; **tap meal header** (chevron affordance) → combined meal detail (summed ring/label + per-food list); applied to BOTH the live-today (`log`) and past-day (`selFoodEntries`) blocks; null-slot entries fold into the first slot (preserved). Done-only (no macro-edit flow exists). 🟡 Follow-up: dedupe `fuel.jsx`'s inline foodDetail to use the shared `NutritionDetail.jsx`. Prior: **COOKING GUIDE PHASE 1 + DIET-TAG RECLASSIFICATION ✅ SHIPPED** (`c6d05ec`, bundle `NativeApp-293a5f8e`). **(A) Cooking guide Phase 1:** added `recipes.instructions` (jsonb: `{prep/cook/total_time_min, yield_servings, sections:[{title,steps:[{n,text,type,active,duration_min,appliance,temp,ingredient_refs}]}], make_ahead, storage, reheat}`) + `recipes.recipe_kind` ('assembly'|'cooked') via migration; **5 seed recipes authored** (Blueberry Yogurt Bowl, Lean Turkey Wrap, Almond Butter Smoothie = assembly; Beef Stir Fry, Baked Salmon = cooked). **Meal-detail screen reskinned** to Fuel system (dropped //, italic-900, SVG donut ring) → title+macros (P-red/C-blue/F-amber bars) → time/servings/diet+allergen chips → ingredients (scaled grams, tappable check-off) → numbered steps (per-step type·duration·appliance·temp) → make-ahead/storage/reheat; **graceful fallback** = macros+ingredients only when no instructions (294 recipes). **Reachable from BOTH** your-week meal cards AND the Kitchen spine (meal names now tappable) via a `detailFrom` tag (Close returns to opener). `loadMealPool`/`fitterDayToShape` carry instructions/recipe_kind/dietTags/allergenTags/primary_diet. **(B) Diet-tag reclassification** (fixes the "Mediterranean shows vegan/carnivore meals" leak — root cause: diet_tags were catch-alls, high-protein on 273/299, mediterranean on 232/299): re-derived ALL 299 `diet_tags` + new `primary_diet` column from a **deterministic classifier** (ingredients + per-serving macros), recorded in `scripts/reclassify-diet-tags.sql`. **Rules:** vegan(no animal) · vegetarian(no meat/fish) · pescatarian(fish,no meat) · carnivore(animal-only, no plant/oil) · paleo(no grain/legume/dairy) · **keto(carbs≤15g & fat≥55% cal)** · **low-carb(carbs≤25g)** · **high-protein(protein≥30g abs)** · **mediterranean(olive oil & (fish OR legume) & no red meat — tightened hard)** · balanced(P20-42/C28-55/F18-42% cal). **primary_diet priority:** carnivore > **mediterranean** > vegan > pescatarian > vegetarian > paleo > keto > low-carb > high-protein > balanced — mediterranean deliberately ABOVE the plant axis because 55/88 Med meals are fish; this makes all 88 Med meals claim `primary='mediterranean'` so the generator's variety-preference draws evenly instead of skewing fishy. **Post-reclassify tag counts:** hp 183, low-carb 180, paleo 129, veg 121, keto 89, med 88, pesc 77, vegan 75, carnivore 50, balanced 29 (all clear the 21-meal-week floor). **Generator wiring** (`fuel.jsx`/`mealFitter.js`): filters on accurate `diet_tags` via `overlaps` (NOT primary as a hard filter — keto needs all 89); `primary_diet` is a −0.05 variety PREFERENCE in `pickForSlot`; **mediterranean snack-slot fallback** to pescatarian/vegetarian (Med has 0 snack recipes) gated in `meetsDiet`/`loadMealPool` to the snack slot only. **DB changes are live server-side** (no redeploy needed — generator reads them at query time). **🟡 FOLLOW-UPS LOGGED:** (1) author the remaining **294 cooking guides**; (2) add **~10-15 Mediterranean poultry/egg/yogurt meals** — Med pool is 55 fish / 33 mostly-legume, only ~1 poultry/egg main → even drawing still leans fish+legume; (3) ✅ **summary-strip "0 min / 0 grocery" bug FIXED** (`6c20374`, bundle `NativeApp-4410105a`): EST PREP now reads `mealPrepPrefs.prepTime` window ('30 min'/'1 hr'/'2+ hrs'); GROCERY computes the merged unique-ingredient count inline (same keying as the grocery sheet) instead of the null `groceryList`; MEALS filter tightened to `!unfillable && m.name`; (4) ✅ **MEDITERRANEAN CUISINE DISQUALIFIERS SHIPPED** (`d074a1d`): the positive med rule still passed Indian/Mexican/Tex-Mex dishes (olive oil + chickpea/veg + tomato) → added disqualifiers: NOT med if ingredients contain cumin/salsa/tortilla/coconut milk/soy sauce/curry OR name contains taco/enchilada/burrito/chili/curry/masala/tikka. Re-ran reclassification: **med 88 → 59** (removed 29 mis-tagged; brk 8/lun 26/din 25/snk 0, snack via the pesc/veg fallback; 0 empty tags). diet_tags + primary_diet recomputed (live server-side). Prior: **MORNING BRIEF ✅ FULLY FIXED** (`3198a6e`, bundle `NativeApp-39f97684`): template engine + hang-proof context, end-to-end verified (a fresh 2026-06-29 row now writes — "Evening, Demo." in the new concise template voice). **TRUE ROOT CAUSE of the 2026-06-26 outage: NOT AI quota — it was a hanging `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition`** in `gatherBriefContext`'s run-athlete weather block. Its `{timeout}` option does NOT run while a WKWebView location-permission prompt is pending, so the `await`ed geo promise never resolved → `gatherBriefContext` never returned → the brief stalled in "loading" and the cache was never written (so DB stayed stuck at the last good 06-26 row). Fix: `withTimeout(promise, ms, fallback)` wraps EVERY network await (geolocation 4.5s, weather 4s, the 11-service enrichment Promise.all 4s each, profiles 6s, food/workout queries 5s, protein/DOMS 4s, cache read 5s / write 6s) — a hang/slow service degrades to the null/empty fallback the template already handles, so gather always completes (bounded, never infinite). Also **ungated generation** in the Today loader (`ob_screens2.jsx:7824` removed the `briefTrigger===0&&briefDismissed` early-return) — the local template is free/instant so it always generates+caches on Today-screen mount; visibility stays gated at render via `!briefDismissed`. Added `[brief]` trace logs (called → no cache → gather done → template done → cached) + `[brief] timeout:<service>` warnings. The earlier AI→template rewrite (`5abedad`) was correct but insufficient alone — the hang was upstream in context-gathering. **Both follow-ups still open:** hybrid-session naming in the brief (point context at `wPrefs.dayPlan`); personality-voicing phase 2 (`adaptMessageSync` + T-map `morning_brief` entry). Prior detail — the brief was **broken system-wide since 2026-06-26** (the `ai()` generation call failing — no briefs generated for any user). Replaced the AI path with a **pure template engine** `buildBriefFromTemplate(ctx)` in `morningBriefService.js` — composes the SAME 6-field shape (`greeting/yesterday/today/coach_says/coach_tip/sign_off`) from the already-gathered structured `gatherBriefContext` data, with **day-of-year-rotated phrasing variants** (per-field offsets; stable within a day, fresh across days). `coach_says` **priority-picks** the single most relevant non-null signal (injury > fatigue > readiness > deload > plateau > validation > streak > sleep > protein/HRV/DOMS/weather/memory > fallback); `coach_tip` paired ≤12 words. **NO `ai()` anywhere in the path** — entire prompt/`ai()`/JSON-parse block deleted; `gatherBriefContext` + the `morning_briefs` cache (user_id+brief_date) unchanged → now local/instant/unbreakable. Temporary `mb_*` analytics breadcrumbs **reverted** (helper + calls + unused `ai` import gone). Personality-READY (lines compose into vars). **🟡 FOLLOW-UPS LOGGED:** (1) **hybrid-session naming in the brief** — point the brief's context builder at `wPrefs.dayPlan` like the Kitchen spine now does, so `today` names "Upper Day"/"5 Mile Run" instead of the program name (currently `ctx.todayFocus`='Training' for hybrids → falls back to splitType "Balanced Hybrid"); (2) **personality-voicing phase 2** — `adaptMessageSync` wrap on `says`/`tip` + a `morning_brief` entry in personalityService's T-map (one-line wrap once the T-map entry exists). Prior: **DIET CARDS + GROCERY-CLOSE ✅ SHIPPED & VERIFIED** (`3cd8932`, bundle `NativeApp-9e634224`): **(1) Diet-style selector** redesigned — 2-col grid → **single-column full-bleed photo cards** (16:10, `/diet-images/{id}.jpg`, `objectFit:cover`, gradient fallback until images land); label + descriptor (`DIET_DESC`) on a **white plate** bottom-left (dark-on-white, legible over any photo) + scrim; **badge** top-left, **selected check** top-right, accent border + glow on selected. All 10 presets + "More styles" expander + persistence (`setMealPrepPrefs`+`saveFlexPrefs`) kept. **(2) Grocery close destination** — `groceryFrom` tag (`'kitchen'`|`'plan'`) + `closeGrocery()`: ✕/Done/backdrop now return to **where it was opened from** (Kitchen base if opened from the spine card, plan screen if opened there) instead of always landing on 'plan'. **🟡 PENDING ASSET DROP:** diet photos into `public/diet-images/` — exact lowercase kebab ids: `balanced, high-protein, mediterranean, keto, paleo, vegetarian, vegan, carnivore, low-carb, pescatarian` (`.jpg`, case-sensitive; only `high-protein`/`low-carb` are hyphenated). Until dropped, cards show the gradient fallback. **NEXT: MORNING BRIEF → pure template engine** (kill the failing `ai()` call; recon in progress). Prior: **KITCHEN POLISH ✅ SHIPPED & VERIFIED** (`8651dd1`, bundle `NativeApp-2585c893`): three Kitchen fixes in one bundle. **(1) Real spine session labels** — `_sessFull`/`_sessShort`/`sessColor` now consult `wPrefs.dayPlan[day]` FIRST (`.run` → "{mi} Mile Run" via `getRunWeek`, `.lift` → split from `dayPlan[day].cycleLabel` or the `HYBRID_TEMPLATE_CYCLES`→`HEAVY_LOWER_CYCLES` derivation that mirrors TrainSection), falling back to `schedule`+`dayFocus` for split programs. **Root cause it fixes:** for hybrids the `schedule` column stores `'training'` for BOTH run and lift days and `dayFocus` is null — the run/lift split + names live ONLY in `dayPlan` (confirmed via DB for fixture `d3d00001`: schedule all-`training`, dayPlan Mon=Upper/Tue=Lower lift, Wed/Sat/Sun run). So generic "TRAINING"/"REST" → now "Upper Day"/"Lower Day"/"X Mile Run"; run days colored blue. Also enriched `fitterDayToShape` ingredients with numeric `qty`+`unit`. **(2) Grocery list redesign** (replaced the flat dedup-only sheet): red sheet w/ white aisle cards grouped by aisle (Produce/Meat & Seafood/Dairy & Eggs/Pantry/Frozen) with **emoji icons from the bundled `fluent-emoji-flat` pack** (`iconData.js`: green-salad/poultry-leg/egg/sheaf-of-rice/ice-cream), **merged quantities** (sum by item+unit, "across N meals" tag) rendered as **shop-friendly units** via `toShoppingQty` ("1 dozen", "2 breasts", "1 bag", "1.5 lb" honoring `profile.wUnit` lb/kg; spices/staples show no qty; oils→"1 bottle"; canned→"N cans"), **check-off + persisted plan-scoped gather-progress** (`cm_grocery_gathered_v1` keyed by plan `generatedAt`) with progress bar, "Cook once · this week" framing, collapsible aisles (long ones default-collapsed), plain "Done" (NO Instacart). **(3) Spine meal names** — show the FULL day's meal list (`-webkit-line-clamp:2` wrap) instead of "{first} +N". All Fuel-system (Archivo, white-on-red, token-based, no //). Prior: **MEAL-PREP LIFECYCLE FOUNDATION ✅ COMPLETE & VERIFIED** (P0s `7a838a5` bundle `NativeApp-c28fc13e` + P1s `947d6af` bundle `NativeApp-4414d957`): the plan lifecycle is now sound under the upcoming plan-screen redesign — **builds forward from today**, **stale-on-ANY-training-change**, **freshness UX**, **today-not-covered** state. **P1s (freshness UX, `947d6af`):** "Planned X days ago" muted line on the Kitchen plan (off the stamped `generatedAt`; legacy timestamp-less plans show no age line); **window-elapsed state** (plan ≥7d old / no remaining days) → day rows replaced by "This week's plan has ended" + "Plan next week →" pill (action pills stay so the old plan's still viewable); **today-not-covered** → home food-log shows a quiet "No prepped meals planned for today" hint only when a plan exists but excludes today, Kitchen spine just shows upcoming days (today not highlighted). Fuel-system styling throughout. **🟡 STILL-LOGGED FOLLOW-UP:** per-DATE periodization lookahead (forward window crossing a mesocycle boundary uses the current block's macro target for the wrapped weekday — session label is right, only macro target may lag a block boundary). **NEXT: the actual MEAL-PREP PLAN screen redesign** (`mealPrepScreen==='plan'`) + its bottom-overlap bug (see below). Prior P0 detail — hardened the plan foundation before the plan-screen redesign. **(1) Stale-on-ANY-training-change** (was program-switch only): `_trainingSig()` (`fuel.jsx:1538`) snapshots `schedule`+`wPrefs.dayFocus`+`mealsPerDay`+program id+rounded per-day `weekMacros` cal/carb (the last folds in mesocycle/phase shifts); stamped on the plan at generate (`plan.trainingSig`+`generatedAt`, `:1810`); mount effect (`:1758`) compares live vs stored → shows the "plan no longer matches" banner on mismatch **without nulling the plan**; DISMISS **re-stamps** the live sig so it sticks until training changes again (`:3394`). Covers program switch / schedule+day-focus edit / phase change / meals-per-day. Legacy sig-less plans guarded out. **(2) Build forward from today**: `generateMealPrepPlan` (`:1784`) now builds a rolling 7-day window starting today (intersected with chosen prep days, today-first) instead of fixed Mon–Sun — kills the "Wednesday problem" (no past weekdays shown as to-prep); each day still resolves its real weekday session via `schedule[day]`/`weekMacros[day]`. **🟡 KNOWN FOLLOW-UP (deferred): per-DATE periodization lookahead** — when the forward window wraps past Sunday into a *different* mesocycle block, the wrapped weekday uses the *current* block's `weekMacros` target (schedule repeats weekly so the session label is right; only the macro target may lag a block boundary). Needs next-week periodization resolution; tracked for the periodization pass. Logged food preserved (regenerate untouched; only re-save merges, keeping manual entries). **NEXT: P1s — freshness UX** ("Planned X days ago" + "Time to plan next week →" when >~7d old or window elapsed; today-not-covered graceful state on Kitchen spine + home). Prior: **SET UP MY WEEK FORM ✅ SHIPPED & VERIFIED** (`2eadc59`, bundle `NativeApp-688e4501`): Fuel-system restyle of all 6 meal-prep setup sections (days/meals-per-day/diet/prep-time/restrictions/generate) — dropped `//`+DM-Mono+italic-900 → Archivo 5-step, white cards on red, muted eyebrows, **solid-accent selected states**, white-pill CTA; **diet grid collapses to 2 popular + "More styles" expander** (`dietExpanded`, all 10 still selectable, active always shown); day chips keep training labels. Styling only — every input + side-effect preserved (mealFreq persistence, slot reset, diet/restriction writes). _(Native build hit a transient CapacitorCordova/Pods cache flake; `rm -rf /tmp/coach-macro-device` fixed it — not a code issue.)_ **NEXT QUEUED: MEAL-PREP PLAN screen redesign + bug** (`mealPrepScreen==='plan'`, fuel.jsx ~:3818+, still old //+italic-900): 🔴 **bottom-overlap bug** — the plan's GROCERY/REGENERATE bar is `position:fixed; bottom:0; zIndex:200` with only `paddingBottom:max(14px,env(safe-area-inset-bottom))`, so it sits ON TOP of the main tab bar (`.app-tab-bar`, `z-index:100`, bottom:0, ~56–72px tall). The log sheet avoids this by being a `position:fixed inset:0 z500` full-screen overlay w/ `paddingBottom:80`; the plan screen is in-flow within the fuel tab so the tab bar shows and the action bar collides. **FIX (queued):** offset the action bar up by tab-bar height (`bottom: calc(tabbarH)`) + bump content pad, OR make mealprep a full-screen overlay above the tab bar. **MORNING BRIEF "not loading" — diagnosed, NOT our session's fault:** load path `ob_screens2.jsx:7826 getMorningBrief → gatherBriefContext → generateBriefContent → ai(prompt,600,'morning_brief')` (`morningBriefService.js:493`); brief imports `resolveProgram`/`selectDayKey`/13 services but **does NOT import `personalityService.js` or `fuel.jsx`** (this session's edits are unrelated + purely additive). Most likely failure = the `ai()` call (rate-limit/quota/auth) or JSON-parse of the AI response (`:495`), surfaced via `morningBriefError`; secondary = an unguarded enrichment service throwing in `gatherBriefContext`. On-device: check console for `[morningBrief]`/`[brief]` errors. Prior: **KITCHEN TRAINING-SPINE WEEK ✅ SHIPPED & VERIFIED** (`91fa04e`, bundle `NativeApp-0c3328ef`): Kitchen now leads with the week as a **training spine** (meal prep as a plan dashboard) — one row per day = colored spine bar + session label (`wPrefs.dayFocus[day]`/sessionType, color by type) + that day's prepped meal names + a per-day macro **why** chip (carbs vs the rest-day baseline from `weekMacros`, reusing the home train→fuel logic). **Today's row highlighted** with a one-tap "Log today's meals →" (routes Home to the existing planned-meal ✓-cards — no new bulk-logger). Eyebrow "YOUR WEEK, FUELED FOR TRAINING" + "{diet} · {N} meals prepped"; View plan / Grocery / Regenerate pills. **Removed the redundant top launcher card + deleted the bottom MEAL PREP section → ONE plan-aware surface**; **recipes demoted** to a secondary section (header fixed white-on-red — was latent red-on-red). Empty state = the Generate-your-week hero. Token-based, Fuel-system styling. (`mealPrepRef` now an unused decl — harmless.) Prior: **LOG-SHEET REDESIGN + WHITE/RED REBALANCE ✅ SHIPPED** (`4edb691`, bundle `NativeApp-838d6888`): the food-log sheet's 5-tile method grid collapsed to **3 named methods** — Scan & Snap (photo+barcode chooser), Describe (folds search/ai-describe/my-foods/quick-add behind one entry + 4-tab toggle), Restaurant AI (moved out of Kitchen; RA overlay z-index 400→600 so it opens above the sheet). Existing **meal lock-step guard surfaced** (Meal 2/3 dimmed+locked until prior logged; tap routes through the existing lock-gate prompt). **Kitchen trimmed to planning** (Meal Prep + recipes; RA carousel card removed, carousel wrapper dropped → plain Meal Prep card). **White/red rebalance:** killed the stray frosted header bar (transparent; ← Close + Meal chip → white-on-red), enlarged log-sheet + Kitchen cards so white dominates with red as framing — all token-based (`var(--cm-paper)`/`--cm-red`). No backend change. **DEFERRED/QUEUED follow-ups:** (1) **photo verification** — Option B (after AI proposal, user confirms/corrects; image-vs-text mismatch → re-prompt) NEEDS a `/api/food-photo` verify mode (backend); insertion point is `PhotoFoodLogger.jsx:770` (the analyzing→confirm seam; the "HERE'S WHAT I SEE" confirm screen stays the review step); (2) **food-log macro-toggle** (calorie⇄P/C/F meal bars — already built earlier, separate queue); (3) **Home↔Kitchen slide animation**; (4) **new-logo SVG swap** (whistle, recolorable to accent — usages mapped). **FUEL ARC ✅ SHIPPED** (`95d009e`, bundle `NativeApp-6b02277b`): hold-to-reveal calorie hero (solo 70px number on red, label above, press-hold fills glyphs bottom-up by macro w/ haptics+shimmer+double-tap lock, ring removed) + **train→fuel** section (names today's session + real macro delta vs rest day, voiced in the user's coaching style via `adaptMessageSync` `train_to_fuel` 6 plain variants + neutral base) + red-forward visual pass (white-on-red hero/macro rows, hold-tied bars, food-log card stays white), WHY-expander + protein-graph removed, Home/Kitchen + CTAs → canonical pills, `//` removed, Archivo 5-step scale. **⚠️ RECOVERED after an uncommitted-file data loss — a stray `sed -i ''` emptied `fuel.jsx`; reconstructed from session edit-history (no other backup existed: no editor history, no sourcemap, no stash), compiles + deployed. LESSON: commit at milestones; avoid in-place `sed` on uncommitted source.** Open Fuel follow-ups: **(1) new-logo SVG swap** (whistle mark, recolorable to accent — separate pass; all usages already mapped: `components.jsx` `Logo` covers in-app, plus `public/coach-macro-logo.png`/`coach-macro-app-icon-1024.png`/`cm-logo-email.png`/`favicon.svg`, iOS AppIcon set + Splash, FAQ broken `/images/app-icon.png`); **(2) planned-meal sub-card + tooltip fonts** still on DM-Mono (bounded-pass leftovers — plus deep sub-screens Log/Kitchen/MealPrep/Restaurant still carry `//`+DM-Mono); **(3) beginner easy-pace floor** + **`current5KTime` normalization** (wprefs MM:SS-string vs profile_data seconds) still pending. **RUN CARD TYPOGRAPHY (Job 3) ✅ SHIPPED & VERIFIED** (`7feb9d7`, bundle `NativeApp-59cbc9a6`): unified 5-step Archivo type scale on run card + WeekStrip (title 18/800 capitalize, eyebrows 10/700 muted, row 13/700, body 13/400, meta 11/600), DM-Mono/Archivo clash killed, GOCLUB-gated; ONE deliberate color change (per-section eyebrow accents → unified muted ink, per the approved T2 spec). Prior: Stage 5 arc COMPLETE; BUG 2, A, B, day-selection "caps at 4" all DONE & verified on-device; morning-brief "didn't load" → NOT a defect. **🔴 NEW PRE-SUBMISSION SECURITY BLOCKER logged: dev-skip is a production backdoor (5-tap logo → auth + paywall bypass; hardcoded creds in bundle) — must remove before App Store.** Open housekeeping: restore the `d3d00001` drift fixture (currently `c25k`). Follow-ups: hybrid run/lift dayPlan split (branch `goclub-redesign`). **Programming Engine Audit Phase 0 recon map appended (2026-06-24) — the audit's factual foundation; next session designs from it.** Hybrid lift fix 1a (`fc8f7a5`, verified) + 1c labels (`11edcbc`, on-device label check pending) shipped; **1b schema extension is next**. **NEW foundational project logged: RUN ENGINE VOLUME MODEL** + design spec + **Phase 0 recon MAJOR CORRECTION: the volume model already EXISTS & is wired — the "defects" are INPUT (run ability borrowed from liftExp, no running-specific tier) / VISIBILITY (weeklyVolumeMi computed but never shown) / cap-tuning, NOT a missing model. Re-sized: fixes (a)-(e) much smaller; long-run-anchor is the one architectural phase.** RUN VOLUME fix (a) **Phase 1 (`7a9595b`) + Phase 2 (`52a12ef`) DONE & VERIFIED on-device** (bundle `NativeApp-7f133c92`): running-specific `deriveRunAbility` replaces the liftExp borrow; ability inputs required in pure-run + hybrid onboarding AND collected on the switch path → all 3 entry points write the same engine-read wPrefs fields. Verified: switch-into-hybrid beginner inputs → `derivedAbility:beginner`/startVol 2.7. **NEXT: fix (b) — long==easy collapse at low volume (buildSessions cap/fraction tuning, small).** **TAB BAR REDESIGN ✅ SHIPPED — final design = BUMPED PILL** (`4cf1e6b`, supersedes `b00045b`): continuous off-white SVG pill with a smooth center hump cradling a bold flush red + (in-place spin to ×), Today centered below the +, 4 inline destinations + sliding accent pill highlight, tap + → quick-log (Water/Food/Workout). Iteration: off-white → dark-glass → bumped pill. **fix (b) ✅ SHIPPED & verified** (`2cca655`): low-volume long==easy collapse fixed (beginner 2.7mi → long 1.5 > easy 1.25). Open tab-bar follow-ups (non-blocking): quick-log Workout/Water handlers, color-swap polish; swipe-swap DROPPED. **RUN CARD ACCURACY ✅ SHIPPED & verified** (`a93e116`): (c) weekly-mileage "WEEKLY · X MI" row in THIS WEEK + VDOT-accurate paces (delegates to paceService Daniels engine; tempo 13:48→13:05) + NaN-proof parser. Follow-ups: `current5KTime` storage inconsistency (wprefs MM:SS-string vs profile_data seconds — normalise writers); beginner easy-pace floor (decision — pure Daniels slow at low VDOT, shipped as-is). Still tracked: run-volume (d)/(e) + long-run anchor, 1b schema, EMOJICON SWAP, tab-bar quick-log Workout/Water handlers._

## 🧪 PENDING DEVICE VERIFICATION (batch)
_**Current committed bundle: `NativeApp-403b5e65`** (run-logging milestone + run-summary redesign, commit `5d3da65`)._

- ✅ **RUN-LOGGING MILESTONE + RUN-SUMMARY REDESIGN — SHIPPED & VERIFIED on-device** (`5d3da65`, bundle
  `NativeApp-403b5e65`). One commit folding: **Tier 1** location usage string; **Tier 2** duration wheels + honest
  run summary (Reached = distance actually run vs Projected = extrapolated, on real 5.0/10.0km thresholds);
  **Edit-dedup** (manual-finish reopen UPDATEs the row, not insert); **AdaptiveBanner** migrated to `--cm-*` tokens;
  **type/spacing pass** (strict mono-numbers / sans-words); **run-summary redesign** — `renderRunSummary()`
  restructured to floating white cards on a red-gradient canvas (hero on red, big stat trio, honest race card,
  quiet calories, splits, **CardGlyph** coach cards using `fluent-emoji-flat` fork-and-knife-with-plate +
  sleeping-face, in-flow Edit/Save). New **`--cm-accent-deep`/`--cm-accent-deep-rgb`** theme tokens (per-theme
  darkened accent via `deepColorRgb`, mirrors `liftColor`, no `color-mix` dependency); `sleeping-face` bundled into
  `iconData.js` via `extract-icons.js`. Verified on-device: clean mono numerals, no double-scroll, floating cards +
  font hierarchy land, AdaptiveBanner tinted, wheels work.
  - 🔵 **TIER 3 (next, not built):** migrate run GPS to **native `@capacitor/geolocation`** — one move carries BOTH
    (a) **background GPS** (track runs with the app backgrounded / screen off) AND (b) the **localhost→"Coach Macro"
    permission-prompt fix** (the WKWebView `navigator.geolocation` prompt names the requesting origin "localhost";
    native geolocation prompts as "Coach Macro"). Also retires the hanging-`getCurrentPosition`-behind-a-prompt class
    of bug (see the morning-brief `withTimeout` note above) at the source rather than by timeout-wrapping.

- ✅ **NUTRITION DETAIL + TODAY-TAB FOOD-LOG PARITY — SHIPPED** (`a0830a3`, bundle `NativeApp-0843cb18`).
  Shared `NutritionDetail.jsx` (ring + Nutrition label + share-of-target bars). Fuel-tab: tappable entries +
  reskinned "Meal plan outdated" banner. Today-tab: food emojis on rows + tappable food/meal-header → single-food /
  combined-meal detail (both live + past-day blocks). Done-only. 🟡 Follow-up: dedupe fuel.jsx inline foodDetail
  into the shared component.

- ✅ **COOKING GUIDE PHASE 1 + DIET RECLASSIFICATION — SHIPPED** (`c6d05ec`, bundle `NativeApp-293a5f8e`).
  Meal-detail reskin + authored-instructions render (graceful fallback), reachable from your-week + Kitchen;
  `instructions`/`recipe_kind` schema + 5 seeds; all 299 `diet_tags` reclassified + `primary_diet` (classifier in
  `scripts/reclassify-diet-tags.sql`); generator filters on accurate tags + primary-diet variety preference + Med
  snack fallback. **Verify on device:** (1) Kitchen/your-week → tap a meal → reskinned detail; regenerate to see seeded
  recipes' Steps. (2) Diet → Mediterranean → regenerate → no vegan/carnivore leak, evened-out (not all-fish) draw.
  DB changes already live server-side. ✅ Plan summary-strip "0 min/0 grocery" bug FIXED (`6c20374`).
  Remaining follow-ups: 294 more cooking guides · ~10-15 Med poultry/egg/yogurt meals. (Med cuisine-disqualifier
  refinement ✅ done — `d074a1d`, med 88→59.)

- ✅ **MORNING BRIEF — FULLY FIXED & VERIFIED** (`3198a6e`, bundle `NativeApp-39f97684`). Template engine
  (`5abedad`) + **hang-proof context** (`3198a6e`). Real root cause of the 06-26 outage = hanging
  `geolocation.getCurrentPosition` behind a WKWebView permission prompt (NOT AI quota); every network await in
  `gatherBriefContext` now `withTimeout`-wrapped, and the Today loader no longer gates generation behind
  dismiss/trigger. **DB-confirmed:** a fresh 2026-06-29 row writes in the new template voice ("Evening, Demo." +
  priority-picked plateau insight). 🟡 Follow-ups: (1) hybrid-session naming (point brief context at `wPrefs.dayPlan`);
  (2) personality-voicing phase 2 (`adaptMessageSync` + T-map `morning_brief` entry).

- ✅ **DIET CARDS + GROCERY-CLOSE — SHIPPED & VERIFIED on-device** (`3cd8932`, bundle `NativeApp-9e634224`).
  (1) Diet selector → single-column full-bleed photo cards (white text-plate, badge, check, accent glow);
  (2) grocery ✕ returns to opener (Kitchen vs plan). 🟡 **Pending asset drop:** `public/diet-images/{id}.jpg`
  (ids: balanced, high-protein, mediterranean, keto, paleo, vegetarian, vegan, carnivore, low-carb, pescatarian) —
  gradient fallback until then. Still uncommitted (temporary): morning-brief `mb_*` breadcrumbs — being removed in the
  next batch (template-engine rewrite replaces the failing ai() brief).

- ✅ **KITCHEN POLISH — SHIPPED & VERIFIED on-device** (`8651dd1`, bundle `NativeApp-2585c893`). (1) Real spine
  session labels (dayPlan-aware run/lift + split names; fixes hybrid "TRAINING"/"REST"); (2) grocery list redesign
  (aisle-grouped, emoji icons, merged + shop-friendly quantities, persisted check-off progress, collapsible, no
  Instacart); (3) full meal-name list on spine rows (2-line wrap, no "+N"). Fuel-system styling. Still uncommitted
  (intentional, temporary): morning-brief `mb_*` breadcrumbs in `morningBriefService.js` — revert after the cause is caught.

- ✅ **MEAL-PREP LIFECYCLE FOUNDATION — COMPLETE & VERIFIED on-device** (P0s `7a838a5` `NativeApp-c28fc13e` + P1s
  `947d6af` `NativeApp-4414d957`). **P0:** (1) stale-on-ANY-training-change via a stamped `trainingSig` (was
  program-switch only); (2) builds forward from today (rolling 7-day window) instead of fixed Mon–Sun; plan stamps
  `generatedAt`. **P1:** "Planned X days ago" muted line; window-elapsed "plan has ended → Plan next week →" state;
  today-not-covered quiet hint on home food-log + spine shows upcoming days. Fuel-system styling.
  🟡 **Still-logged deferred follow-up:** per-DATE periodization lookahead (forward window crossing a mesocycle boundary
  uses the current block's macro target for the wrapped weekday). **NEXT: the actual MEAL-PREP PLAN screen redesign +
  bottom-overlap bug** (see header). Also still uncommitted (intentional, temporary): morning-brief `mb_*` breadcrumbs in
  `morningBriefService.js` — revert after the cause is caught.

- ✅ **DAY LABELS — SHIPPED & VERIFIED on-device** (`571b1e2`). Real per-day session labels in Kitchen spine + setup
  chips (lifting → "{split} Day", running → "{mi} Mile Run", rest → "Rest"; compact variant for chips). Label-content
  only, styling unchanged.

- ✅ **SET UP MY WEEK FORM — SHIPPED & VERIFIED on-device** (`2eadc59`, bundle `NativeApp-688e4501`). Fuel-system restyle
  of all 6 setup sections; solid-accent selected states; diet grid → 2 popular + expander (all 10 selectable); styling
  only, inputs/side-effects preserved. NEXT: meal-prep PLAN screen redesign + the bottom-overlap bug (see header).

- ✅ **KITCHEN TRAINING-SPINE WEEK — SHIPPED & VERIFIED on-device** (`91fa04e`, bundle `NativeApp-0c3328ef`). Kitchen
  leads with the week as a training spine (per-day session + prepped meals + macro-why vs rest), today's row highlighted
  + one-tap log, redundant launcher removed (one plan-aware surface), recipes demoted (header white-on-red). Empty state
  = Generate-your-week hero. Follow-up (optional): "Log today's meals" currently routes Home to the planned ✓-cards —
  could become an in-place bulk-log; `mealPrepRef` is now an unused decl.

- 🟡 **LOG-SHEET REDESIGN + WHITE/RED REBALANCE — SHIPPED & committed (`4edb691`); on-device eyeball recommended.**
  3 methods (Scan & Snap chooser / Describe / Restaurant AI), surfaced meal lock-step (dimmed+locked Meal 2/3),
  Kitchen trimmed to Meal Prep + recipes, stray white header bar removed, bigger white-forward cards. Frontend only —
  PhotoFoodLogger / BarcodeScanner / search-ai-myfoods-quick sub-views unchanged; the "HERE'S WHAT I SEE" confirm screen
  stays the review step. **Verify:** Scan & Snap → Photo/Barcode; Describe 4-tab toggle; Restaurant AI opens above the
  sheet (z-fix) and adds to the selected meal; Meal 2/3 locked until Meal 1 logged; header has no white strip + the Meal
  chip reads white-on-red. Deferred: photo verification (Option B, backend), macro-toggle (queued), Home↔Kitchen slide,
  new-logo swap.

- 🟡 **FUEL ARC — SHIPPED & committed (`95d009e`); on-device eyeball still recommended.** Hold-to-reveal hero +
  train→fuel intelligence + red-forward visual pass (full description in the header line). Committed & deployed
  (`NativeApp-6b02277b`), compiles clean. **Reconstructed from session edit-history after a `sed -i ''` emptied the
  uncommitted `fuel.jsx`** — faithful to the transcript and verified vs the running bundle, but a human glance at the
  Fuel screen is the final confirmation nothing subtle drifted. Open follow-ups (non-blocking): new-logo SVG swap;
  planned-meal sub-card + tooltip fonts (+ deep sub-screens) still on DM-Mono/`//`; beginner easy-floor +
  `current5KTime` normalization.

- ✅ **RUN CARD TYPOGRAPHY (Job 3) — SHIPPED & VERIFIED on-device** (commit `7feb9d7`, bundle `NativeApp-59cbc9a6`).
  Applied the approved 5-step type scale, **type-only** (size/weight/spacing/font/transform/line-height + capitalize on title);
  no logic/engine/value changes. ~12 style objects across the run card (`sections.jsx` ~:4185–4213) + `WeekStrip` (~:1910–1963):
  - **T1 title** 14/700 lowercase → **18/800, -0.01em, capitalize**, Archivo (`long run`→`Long Run`).
  - **T2 eyebrows** unified to **Archivo 10/700/0.14em caps, muted ink (0.55)** — ALL section labels (YOUR PACES TODAY /
    PRE-RUN FUEL / RECOVERY FUEL / NUTRITION BRIDGE / WeekStrip THIS WEEK / WEEKLY row label).
  - **T3 row title** WeekStrip day labels 14 → **13/700 caps**.
  - **T4 body** consolidated 11/12px → **13/400, lh 1.6, ink 0.8** (description, fuel/bridge bodies, pace rows). Pace numeric
    values keep **700 + monospace** (tabular).
  - **T5 meta** consolidated 9/10px → **11/600/0.04em** (chips, WeekStrip day codes + status). WEEKLY value → 13/800 accent.
  - **DM-Mono killed** on the WeekStrip (eyebrow + day codes + status) → unified to Archivo, ending the DM-Mono/Archivo clash.
    Shared WeekStrip type props gated on `GOCLUB_REDESIGN` (mirrors the existing label pattern at :1950) so the legacy dark
    theme is untouched.
  - **⚠️ ONE deliberate color change** (everything else was pure type): the per-section eyebrow accent colors (paces=red,
    pre-fuel=amber, recovery=green, bridge=red) were collapsed to a **single muted ink (0.55)** — this is baked into the
    approved **T2 spec** ("ONE treatment for ALL section labels … muted ink ~55%"), the intentional move that kills the
    rainbow-eyebrow noise. Box backgrounds/borders unchanged (still color-coded). Body text also nudged full-ink → ink-0.8
    per the T4 spec. No other colors touched.

- ✅ **RUN VOLUME Phase 1 + Phase 2 — VERIFIED on-device & committed** (`7a9595b` Phase 1, `52a12ef` Phase 2; batch row
  23:39). Switch-into-hybrid with entered beginner values (`longestRunMi:1`/`currentRunsPerWeek:0`) →
  `derivedAbility:"beginner"`, `startVol` 2.7 (beginner band) — vs the stale-fixture rows (`6/4 → intermediate/18`).
  `run_ability` breadcrumb reverted; clean-rebuild deployed. **(Surfaced fix (b) — see RUN ENGINE VOLUME MODEL: at
  beginner 2.7mi/wk easy AND long both round to 1.25; distribution-math tuning, separate + small.)**
- ✅ **1c hybrid lift-day LABELS — RE-CONFIRMED on-device** (`d3d00001` shows PPL: PUSH/PULL/LEGS week strip + correct
  Wed header). The earlier `11edcbc` "on-device label check pending" note is now cleared.

## STACK & PATHS
- **Stack:** Capacitor v5 + React 18 + Vite, running in **WKWebView** (native iOS shell).
- **Repo:** `~/Developer/coach-macro` — working branch **`goclub-redesign`** (default branch is `main`).
- **Feature flag:** `GOCLUB_REDESIGN`.
- **Supabase project:** `oxxihlwqukbakmnnavuy` (region us-east-2). Inspect/logs/SQL via the Supabase MCP.
- **Device (physical test iPhone):** UDID `00008110-000C149636EA401E` (iPhone 13 Pro Max, iOS 17.7).
  Paired for **wireless debugging** (`iPhone-3.coredevice.local`) — cable not required when it shows
  `available (paired)` in `xcrun devicectl list devices`. Keep it unlocked/awake during builds.
- **Mandatory build chain** (the `rm -rf` prefix is required — stale `public/` causes ghost builds):
  ```sh
  rm -rf ios/App/App/public && npm run build:sim && npx cap copy ios && npx cap sync ios && \
  xcodebuild -workspace ios/App/App.xcworkspace -scheme App -configuration Debug \
    -destination "platform=iOS,id=00008110-000C149636EA401E" -derivedDataPath /tmp/coach-macro-device build && \
  xcrun devicectl device install app --device 00008110-000C149636EA401E \
    /tmp/coach-macro-device/Build/Products/Debug-iphoneos/App.app && \
  xcrun devicectl device process launch --device 00008110-000C149636EA401E com.coachmacro.app
  ```
  - Compile-only (no device): swap destination for `-destination 'generic/platform=iOS'`.
  - Each successful web build prints a fresh `dist/assets/NativeApp-<hash>.js` — use it to confirm the build is current.
- **⚠️ Do NOT confuse with `~/CoachMacro`** — that is a *separate* React Native side-project. All work
  here is the Capacitor app at `~/Developer/coach-macro`.

## DONE & VERIFIED (recent)
- **Apple Health: reads + HRV + workout-WRITE all working end-to-end on device** (commits **`bbe5cb8`**, **`7ef0ae2`**, **`234e360`**).
  HRV reads confirmed (`ah_hrv_ok`) — supersedes the older "HRV pending device verification" note. Technical detail:
  - Native-bridge **stall** fixed — `hk()` returned the Capacitor plugin proxy from an `async` fn; the proxy is
    thenable (no `then` guard) → `await hk()` hung forever. Fixed via non-thenable `{ kit }` container.
  - Method name `querySampleType` → **`queryHKitSampleType`**; query keys `stepCount`, HRV.
  - HRV via `patch-package` (`patches/@perfood+capacitor-healthkit+1.3.2.patch`): native `getTypes` + `getSampleType`
    + `generateOutput`(→ms); plus the `saveWorkout` `@objc` method + `.m` registration in the same patch.
  - Per-call timeouts (import/isAvailable 8s, requestAuth 30s, getters 10s, saveWorkout 4s) + `ah_*` breadcrumbs (with `tier`/`bmr`).
  - **Biometric active-energy** (Mifflin-St Jeor, **active-only `(MET−1)`**, two-tier) unified across **lifting/run/HYROX**
    via shared `src/utils/calorieEstimate.js` → `estimateActiveKcal`; feeds in-app ring + DB `calories_burned` + HK write.
    **Run distance wired** (GPS + manual → real `distanceMeters`). Lifting + HYROX writes verified on-device; Tier-2 graceful
    degradation verified on-device (demo has null DOB → `tier:2`, `bmr:null`, never NaN/0); Tier 1 verified via parity (`bmr:1699`).
- **Program-drift resolver Stages 1–4** — `resolveProgram()` / `selectDayKey()` canonical sources; Train tab migrated;
  race-countdown gate; week-counter sourced from profile load (commit **`1ce6c3f`**).
- **Today-tab program-switch drift — RESOLVED** (was OPEN bug #1; commits **`bb274b9`**, **`0c5d52c`**, **`4782a36`**, **`11ca449`**).
  The morning-brief service (`morningBriefService.js` → `resolveProgram` `_mode` + `selectDayKey`/`baseName` day label) and the
  Today workout-for-the-day section (`ob_screens2.jsx` `_todayMode = resolveProgram(...).mode`; day label = `dayFocus[todayKey]`,
  which `NativeApp` builds via `selectDayKey`+`baseName`) now read the **identical canonical sources Train uses** — Today, Train,
  and the brief can't drift from each other. Verified consistent on drift account `d3d00001` (`_libraryId=hyrox_8w` → all three resolve to hyrox).
- **Upper/Lower split-day title-vs-exercises mismatch — RESOLVED by Stage 6** (commit **`11ca449`**, 2026-06-20 21:51 — *after* the
  Jun-20 screenshot). Both the day **title** (`dayFocus` → `selectDayKey`+`baseName`) and the day **exercises**
  (`getWorkoutForDay`, which internally calls `selectDayKey(splitType, daysPerWeek, schedule, programStartDate, dayOffset)` when
  schedule+anchor present) now derive "which split day" from **one** schedule-aware, `program_start_date`-anchored walk with matching
  args (same `splitType`, `daysPerWeek`, `dayOffset 0` for today). Retired the `SPLIT_CYCLES` dual-vocabulary that caused the desync.
  (No live Upper/Lower row in DB to spot-check; aligned by code analysis.)
- **Session restore / workout-save** — v2 storage-key fix, `processLock` auth hardening, distinct-day session count —
  all shipped (supersedes the Jun 19 "workouts not saving" priority docs).
- **Onboarding completion — FULLY FIXED & verified on-device** — breadcrumb-confirmed (`plan_confirm_write_ok` **+** `plan_confirm_pre_nav`,
  no error this run); row `_libraryId=upper_lower` / `split=Upper/Lower` / `plan_built=true`; screen lands on **Today (5-tab) in-session**.
  Three layers (instrumentation found the real cause — the await/timer theory was wrong):
  - **Real root cause (the in-session no-nav bug):** `onProtocolRefetch` (`ob_screens2.jsx:11313`) chained `.catch()` directly onto a
    `sb.from(...).delete().eq().eq()` **Postgrest thenable** — which has `.then` but **no `.catch`** → `catch is not a function` thrown
    **synchronously** right after the write resolved, aborting `handleConfirm` *before* `_spb(true)` / `setSection("today")`. Fix:
    `.catch(()=>{})` → **`.then(()=>{},()=>{})`**. Disproved the earlier await/timer-throttle hypothesis: breadcrumbs showed
    `write_ok` fired, `pre_nav` never did, and `plan_confirm_error` named the exact line.
  - **Sibling sweep (same misuse):** fixed 2 more **live** sites — `NativeApp.jsx` (bodyweight starter-log upsert) and
    `services/coachMemoryService.js` (coach-memory upsert; was `await …catch` → also throws since `.catch` evaluates before `await`).
    Audited all **236** `.catch(` in `src/`: no other live occurrences (5 remaining are in dead `src/_legacy/`, not imported/bundled — left as-is).
  - **Hardening retained (correct, though NOT the cause):** (a) single **atomic timeout-guarded upsert** (`ob_screens2.jsx:4354`,
    `Promise.race` 15s) writes `wprefs`+`schedule`+`profile_data`+`plan_built` together (no half-apply; replaced upsert + separate
    `markPlanBuilt`); (b) **nav de-coupled from any awaited `setTimeout`** — `setSection("today")` + `setSaving/setBuilding(false)`
    now fire synchronously after the write (dropped the cosmetic 1.5s "Building…" minimum so a throttled WKWebView timer can't wedge nav).
  - **Instrumentation kept:** `plan_confirm_write_ok` / `plan_confirm_pre_nav` / `plan_confirm_error` breadcrumbs + the `_crumb`
    helper (`ob_screens2.jsx:4279`) — **KEEP for now** (cheap observability on the critical onboarding path); gate/strip with the
    `ah_*` diagnostic breadcrumbs pre-release.
- **Design system locked** — Me tab, Today/Train/Fuel reskins, weight logging, security/RLS.

## 🔴 PRE-SUBMISSION BLOCKERS — canonical gate list (must ALL clear before App Store)
_Consolidated 2026-07-06. THIS is the single source of truth for "what must be resolved before submission" — nothing ships to the App Store (or web production) with an un-cleared 🔴 here. Detailed context for the 🟡 items also lives inline lower in this doc (line refs noted)._

### 🔴 BLOCKERS — cannot ship
1. **Auth/payment PRODUCTION BACKDOOR (dev-skip).** `showDevSkip = import.meta.env.DEV || localStorage.devmode==='true'`;
   the **5-tap-logo gesture** (`handleLogoTap`, `NativeApp.jsx:253-264`) sets `localStorage.devmode='true'` → in a **PROD build**
   this exposes: (a) the dev-skip button + **autologin into hardcoded creds `testuser@coachm.dev` / `CoachTest123!` that SHIP IN
   THE BUNDLE**, (b) `isDevAccount` **subscription bypass** (`:545`), (c) `devEmail` **paywall-skip** (`:908`). Anyone can tap the
   logo 5× in the shipped app to **bypass auth AND payment**. ~10 sites: `showDevSkip:252`, `VITE_AUTO_DEVMODE:251`,
   `handleLogoTap:253-264`, `handleDevSkip:267`, `handleOnboardingTest:306`, buttons `:422/425/484/487`, `isDevAccount:545`,
   `devEmail:908`. **MUST be removed before submission.** Kept through dev (drives testuser/dev-skip testing); remove + on-device
   welcome/signin glance at submission time.
2. **Web deploy pipeline BROKEN — Vercel Hobby 12-function limit** (diagnosed 2026-07-06, not fixed). Every production/preview
   deploy fails at step `patchBuild` with `errorCode: exceeded_serverless_functions_per_deployment` ("No more than 12 Serverless
   Functions … on the Hobby plan"). The `api/` dir has **14 functions** (12 endpoints + `api/middleware/logger.js` + `rateLimit.js`,
   which Vercel counts). The Vite build compiles fine — the deploy is rejected post-build. **Every deploy for weeks has failed**, so
   the corrected privacy policy (Sentry disclosure etc.) has never reached production and Sentry is live-collecting under a stale policy.
   **FIX:** upgrade the team to **Vercel Pro** (limit ~100), OR free interim = move the 2 `api/middleware/*` helpers out of `api/`
   (→ 12, at the limit). **Production branch is `main`, not `goclub-redesign`** (goclub-redesign only makes previews). Legal fix is
   staged: branch **`legal-hotfix-main`** (`0a54c82`, pushed) + PR-ready → merge to `main` only AFTER this is fixed.

### 🟡 MUST-VERIFY / CLEANUP before submission (not security-critical)
3. **Clinical-records / provisioning entitlement cleanup** — verify portal App ID + provisioning profile carry only what's used
   (binary entitlements currently clean). [detail ~"Clinical-records" bullet below]
4. **HRV full device verification** — reads work (`ah_hrv_ok`); the Settings-permission-sheet + real HRV data needs an Apple Watch
   wearer, cleanest via delete/reinstall so HRV is in the initial grant. [detail ~"HRV full device verification" bullet below]
5. **Analytics breadcrumbs keep-vs-gate** — `ah_*` / `tier` / `bmr` / `plan_confirm_*` breadcrumbs kept through dev for cheap
   observability; **gate or strip before App Store**. [detail ~"Breadcrumb keep-vs-gate" bullet below]

---

## OPEN — correctness bugs (highest priority)
- ✅ **RunProgramSetup time inputs auto-dismiss keyboard (~2s) — FIXED & verified keyboard-free on-device** (bundle `NativeApp-bc47f05d`).
  Root cause found: the TrainSection eyebrow rotator (`sections.jsx:2225` `_switchProgIdx`, 2.5s `setInterval`) kept ticking with
  no `trainScreen` guard → re-rendered all of TrainSection (incl. the library sub-screen's `RunProgramSetup` time `<input>`s) every
  ~2.5s → dismissed the iOS soft keyboard. Two fixes applied:
  - **FIX 1 (root cause):** gated the interval `if(_trainEyeRedMo || trainScreen!=='today')return;` + added `trainScreen` to deps
    (`sections.jsx:2226`). `_switchProgIdx` is consumed at exactly one site (`sections.jsx:5002`, the eyebrow), so pausing it off
    the main screen has no side effect.
  - **FIX 2 (robust + polished):** ported the Me-tab `Rolodex` wheel (keyboard-free) into `TimeInputMMSS`/`HMSInput`
    (`RunProgramSetup.jsx`) via a new `WheelField` wrapper. Value contract UNCHANGED — each wheel emits the same numeric string
    into the same setter → `parseMMSS`/`parseHMS` → identical total seconds → identical saved keys (`baselineTime`/
    `currentTotalTime`/`goalTime`/`goalTotalTime`). Empty run fields show a dimmed/red "needs input" treatment; CTA stays disabled
    until set. `raceDate` (`type="date"`) left as-is.
  - **Verified on-device:** scroll-wheel time entry works keyboard-free (no ~2s dismiss). The separate `runProfile` persistence
    failure turned out NOT to be the keyboard — it was the `doActualSwitch` profile_data clobber (see BUG 1 below).
  - **FOLLOW-UP (minor, tracked):** brief visual flicker on the wheels (cosmetic) — investigate later; not blocking.
  - **FOLLOW-UP (separate, real users hit it):** the **running goal-time** field (`RunProgramSetup.jsx:637`, `TimeInputMMSS`) is
    **MM:SS** and is shown for `half` and `full` goal distances — a half goal (~90–150 min) and a full (~180–360 min) both exceed
    the MM cap of 99, so those runners can't enter a goal time. Pre-existing (old `<input max=99>` had the same ceiling). Fix: give
    `half`/`full` goals an H:MM:SS field (use `HMSInput`). Not done here.
- ✅ **`doActualSwitch` profile_data clobber — FIXED & VERIFIED ON-DEVICE** (`ProgramLibrary.jsx`). On a fresh Balanced Hybrid
  setup (`d3d00001`), `profile_data.runProfile` **populated and survived the switch** — `baselineTime=660` (11:00 mile) /
  `goalTime=1963` (32:43) stored as correct total-seconds, `has_runProfile=true`. The clobber no longer drops the runProfile.
  Library program switches with a calorie change (`calc.delta!==0`) overwrote `profile_data` with the **stale React `profile` closure**,
  dropping the `runProfile`/`hyroxProfile` that `RunProgramSetup.saveRunProfile` had just written → run/hybrid setup data never
  persisted (the real cause of `has_runProfile=false` — NOT the keyboard, and NOT a dual client: `client.js` just re-exports
  `supabase.js`'s single `sb`). Fix: re-fetch current `profile_data` and merge only the nutrition keys onto it (read-then-merge, like
  `mergeProfileData`), with a fetch-failure guard that skips the `profile_data` write rather than wiping. Ordering confirmed:
  `await saveRunProfile` commits before `onConfirm → confirmSwitch → doActualSwitch` re-fetch.
- ✅ **BUG 2 — phantom 5K on hybrid — DONE & VERIFIED on-device.** Race is now OPTIONAL.
  Root cause (write-path ruled out by the breadcrumb test): the "5K" came from the **INPUT** forcing a distance
  (`runProfile.goalDistance="5k"`, a write-only field) + render `||'5k'` fallbacks — NOT a `run_race_type` column writer.
  Fix (`RunProgramSetup.jsx` + `sections.jsx`): "Training for a race?" **toggle** (default OFF for `program.isHybrid`, ON for
  pure-run); CTA relaxed + `proceedToConfirm` goal-validation gated on `raceGoal`; **no-race `saveRunProfile` branch** stores
  `raceGoal:false` and **omits** `goalDistance`/`goalTime`/`raceDate` (never writes `run_race_type`/`run_race_date`); Step 5 +
  red-hero show **"General Fitness"**. Verified on-device: no-race hybrid still gets run days + paces, no phantom 5K/countdown;
  race path persists `raceDate` and the countdown shows on load. (`runProfile.goalDistance`/`goalTime` confirmed write-only —
  zero readers; run engine derives distance from the `run_race_type` column null→`'5k'` zones, with a `'general'` path.)
  Breadcrumbs reverted across all 4 files.
- ✅ **In-session `runProfile` staleness — FIXED & VERIFIED on-device** (commit `3f1b83c`, the "A" fix). `doActualSwitch` now
  re-fetches `profile_data` up front, writes `run_race_date` to the **column** from the freshly-saved `runProfile.raceDate` on a
  run/hybrid target (null-safe → BUG 2 preserved; fetch-fail → preserve), and propagates `run_race_date` + `runProfile` into the
  `onProfileUpdate` React patch. Race countdown/paces now refresh **in-session** (no relaunch); also feeds the other
  `run_race_date`-column readers. Verified: in-session countdown on a race switch, no phantom on a no-race switch.
- ✅ **Run/hybrid day selection ignored ("caps at 4") — FIXED & VERIFIED on-device** (commit `572f811`). User-picked 5–6
  training days persisted to `runProfile.trainDays` but never rebuilt the schedule — `activateProgramMode` retyped the prior
  program's schedule, silently capping at the old day count. Now `activateProgramMode` takes `trainDays` and rebuilds the schedule
  from it when present+non-empty (selected → `dayType`, rest → `'rest'`; **exact selection, no cap**), else the retype-preserve
  fallback (lifting switches, which carry no `trainDays`); `doActualSwitch` threads `_freshRun.trainDays` from the existing A
  re-fetch (one read). Verified on `d3d00001`: 5-day `c25k` pick → 5 run days, `trainDays == schedule`, no cap.
- ✅ **Morning brief "didn't load" on run account — INVESTIGATED, NOT a defect.** Stale-cache/date-rollover blip (a `2026-06-22`
  cached brief while the device rolled to `2026-06-23`); self-resolved on cache-clear + reload. The brief **regenerates correctly
  for run/no-race** — verified via a fresh `morning_briefs` row (coherent `c25k` content) and **zero `brief_error` breadcrumbs**.
  The static pass was right: no unguarded null-read on the run/no-race path. (Temporary `brief_error` breadcrumb reverted.)
- **BUG/GAP — hybrid run/lift day split not generated from `trainDays`** — OPEN. `RunProgramSetup` collects no per-day run/lift
  assignment and builds no `dayPlan`; only onboarding does. So a hybrid set up via program-switch has **no `dayPlan`** →
  `deriveDayModality` Path 3 (degenerate: every training day = both run AND lift) AND `sections.jsx:2543` gates `hybridModality`
  on `dayPlan`, so the hybrid run-day UI doesn't compute. The day-COUNT fix (schedule-rebuild above) does NOT address this.
  **DESIGN SETTLED (recon 06-23):** extract onboarding's existing inline generator (`_infPlan`, `ob_screens2.jsx`
  `run_daymodality` step) into a shared `buildHybridDayPlan(trainDays, splitType)` in `running_programs.js` (reuses the
  already-present `HEAVY_LOWER_CYCLES`/`HEAVY_LOWER_LABELS` — the onboarding `_CYCS`/`_HEAVY_LABELS` were verified
  byte-identical dups). Wire into `activateProgramMode` (hybrid target + `trainDays` present → set `wPrefsUpdate.dayPlan`)
  and refactor onboarding to call the shared fn. Heuristic VERBATIM (lifts = `min(cycle-len | floor(n/2) | 3, n−2)`, ≥1,
  reserve ~2 runs). **BUILT (Pass 2, `NativeApp-df7bb7ec.js`) — onboarding parity proven byte-identical; NOT yet
  committed.** Pass 2 also resolved the original "generic upper" wrinkle via `HYBRID_TEMPLATE_CYCLES` (hybrid template
  name → a real lift-split cycle: Strength-Biased→PPL, Run-Biased/Balanced/Foundation→Upper/Lower, Tactical→PPL; Hyrox
  excluded) and folded in the `longRunDay` anchor (chosen day forced to a run day).
  - ✅ **RESOLVED in Pass 2 (`43f6ae1`) — long-run source-of-truth split + vetoable preference.** The switch wrote the user's
    `longRunDay` pick to `runProfile.longRunDay` (which the dayPlan honors), but the run-engine session-type
    reconciliation (`getRunWeek` `running_programs.js:1607`) reads **`wPrefs.longRunDay`**, which the switch leaves
    **stale** → chosen day becomes a run but gets an **easy** session, long run lands elsewhere. **FIX (decided: SYNC + PRESERVE VETO).** Sync-ONLY is insufficient: `generateRunWeek`/`buildSessions` never receive
    the pick (they compute a DOMS-safe day themselves), and the post-engine reconciliation (`running_programs.js:1607`)
    blindly overrides it — so syncing alone *forces obedience* and kills the safeguard. Agreed wiring = 3 coordinated
    changes: **(A)** sync `wPrefsUpdate.longRunDay = longRunDay` on run/hybrid when fresh pick present
    (`ProgramLibrary.jsx:83`); **(B)** thread `wPrefs.longRunDay` → `generateRunWeek` → `buildSessions` and make it the
    FIRST entry in the placement preference loop (`runEngine.js:362`) under the SAME DOMS/adjacency guards
    (`[preferredLongDay,'Sat','Sun'].filter(Boolean)`) → recovery-fine pick honored, recovery-bad pick fails the guard
    and the engine moves it (veto intact); **(C)** delete the blind reconciliation (`running_programs.js:1607-1630`).
    This ALSO dissolves the quality-day case (engine picks long day first; quality days exclude it via
    `candidates = days.filter(d => d !== longRunDay)`) — no limitation to track. Transparent messaging = the Transparent
    Recovery-Aware Long Run item below (NOT this fix). APPLIED + committed in `43f6ae1`; engine harness (`getRunWeek`
    end-to-end) proved honor/veto/fallthrough for SHORT names.
  - 🟡 **Pass 2 DEVICE-VERIFICATION IN PROGRESS (resume next session) — do NOT push `43f6ae1`, do NOT revert the
    breadcrumb, until all 3 resolve.** Engine harness proved the logic; on-device render verification is incomplete.
    State: Pass 2 committed (`43f6ae1`) **NOT pushed**; temp `lr_decision` breadcrumb **uncommitted** (live as
    `NativeApp-c78f2589.js`); `d3d00001` collapsed to this test setup (`strength_run`, 5-day). Threads (#2 RESOLVED;
    **#1 and #3 remain — resolve #1 first**):
    1. ✅ **RESOLVED — NOT A BUG.** User clarified the pick was **Mon/Tue/Wed/Sat/Sun (5 days, no Thursday)** — exactly
       what the DB shows (`trainDays=[Mon,Tue,Wed,Sat,Sun]`). Last session's "6 days + Thursday" was a description
       misremember, not a save failure; the day-count save path is correct. (The "long-run Sunday" recollection vs
       DB `longRunDay=Sat` is also explained by thread #3: user PICKED Sat, the safeguard MOVED the long run to Sun,
       so the user saw Sunday and conflated it with the pick.)
    2. ✅ **RESOLVED — NOT A BUG (recon).** `HYBRID_TEMPLATE_CYCLES` resolves correctly: `d.splitType = prog.name =
       "Strength-Biased Hybrid"` (hyphen) matches the map key (hyphen) exactly → chain resolves to **Push/Pull/Legs**.
       The observed `[upper, upper, heavy_lower]` dayPlan **IS** PPL — it's the signature (`heavy_lower` on the **3rd**
       lift day = Legs as PPL's 3rd entry; Upper/Lower would put it **2nd**, generic-null would have **none**). The
       "looks like Upper/Lower" was a `liftFocus`-vocabulary misread: `liftFocus` is a 3-value enum
       (`heavy_lower|full|upper`) so Push AND Pull both render `"upper"`. Every consumer reads `liftFocus` only as
       `=== 'heavy_lower'` (`deriveDayModality:1433`, `ob_screens2:4753/4808`), so the Push/Pull distinction isn't lost
       (workout content comes from `splitType`+cycle downstream, not `liftFocus`). No key to align.
    3. **`lr_decision` breadcrumb didn't fire (no rows) — `getRunWeek` not hit on the run-day view used.** Determine
       where `getRunWeek` actually runs / why no log, so the honor/veto test CAN be verified. (Breadcrumb stays
       uncommitted; keep it.)
  - **ENHANCEMENT (future):** template-specific run:lift ratio — differentiate strength-biased vs run-biased templates
    (the generic `n−2` heuristic only varies bias by cycle length; no per-template ratio data exists). [audit's job]
- _**Onboarding-completion auto-nav** (was here) is RESOLVED — see DONE & VERIFIED.
  Read-side drift bugs (Today-tab program-switch; Upper/Lower title-vs-exercises) also RESOLVED._

---

## program-drift Stage 5 — ✅ COMPLETE (resolver 1–2 · 5a · 5b · 5d)
_Whole drift arc done: read-time resolver (Stages 1–2), write-path prevention (5a onboarding `_libraryId` backfill + 5b
opposite-mode field clearing on switch), and 5d (investigated — reconciliation unnecessary; residual stored-field drift is
inert). The catalog flag-fix also shipped. Only an optional confirmatory 5b hop-4 remains (non-blocking)._
- ✅ **Stage 5a — Backfill `_libraryId` on WRITE — DONE** (commit `2b31be5`; verified on-device): active PlanOnboarding
  `handleConfirm` infers the catalog id via `inferEntryFromFields` (strength→splitType, run→runPlan; hyrox/hybrid→null to
  avoid the `Full Body`→`full_body` misfire). Verified: `d3d00001` `_libraryId` `hyrox_8w → upper_lower`, `resolveProgram`
  `source:"libraryId"`. (Legacy `saveProfile`/`handleTrainDone` path is dead under `NEW_ONBOARDING=true` — intentionally not patched.)
- ✅ **Stage 5b — Program switches CLEAR opposite-mode fields — core VERIFIED on-device** (commit `a281f97`).
  `activateProgramMode`/`doActualSwitch` (`ProgramLibrary.jsx`) rewritten to an **enumerated program-mode patch**
  (owned values + explicit off-mode nulls; only program-mode keys named, so the spread preserves all shared state). Run-detail
  (`runFocus`/`currentRunsPerWeek`/`longestRunMi`/`planWeeks`/`recoveryCapacity`/`runPlanStartDate`/`longRunDay`) + run columns
  (`run_race_date`/`run_target_time`/`recovery_capacity`/`run_race_type`) preserved on **run AND hybrid**, cleared on **lifting +
  hyrox** (hybrid = combined run+lift; both consume `buildRunEngineInputs`). `dayPlan` cleared off-hybrid, **preserved on hybrid**
  (recon proved nulling it disables hybrid run-routing — `sections.jsx:2543` gates `hybridModality` on it; no schedule re-derivation).
  `current_program` orphan now synced to new `splitType`.
  - **Verified on `d3d00001` (bundle `NativeApp-3d117a12`):** hop 1 (→ Upper/Lower) = the four-way-drift collapse
    (`isHyrox+isLifting` both-true → clean lifting; stale `runPlan`/`hyroxProgram`/`hybridTemplate`/run-cols → null;
    `current_program` `ppl_6`→`upper_lower` = `_libraryId`); hop 2 (→ 10K running) = run owned, lift/hyrox cleared.
    Both PASS on all four checks: **cleared / owned / shared byte-identical / bio intact** (wprefs 12 shared fields unchanged;
    `profile_data` bio fully intact — only `goalCals` recalc + stale program-mirror moved, which is the pre-existing
    `doActualSwitch:755` clobber, not a 5b leak).
  - **Hop 3 (→ Balanced Hybrid) PASS** — owned (`isHybrid`, `hybridTemplate`, `splitType`), cleared (`isLifting/isRunFocus/isHyrox`,
    `runPlan/hyroxProgram`), **run-detail PRESERVED** (`currentRunsPerWeek=4`/`longestRunMi=6`/`recoveryCapacity=normal`/`longRunDay=Sat`
    survived — the preserve test hop 2 couldn't do), shared byte-identical. (Surfaced BUG 2's phantom-5K framing + the
    `doActualSwitch` clobber, both tracked above.)
  - **Hop 4 (return-trip → lifting) — optional confirmatory, non-blocking** — would confirm run+hybrid fields all clear on a
    switch back to a pure mode; 5b's clear-logic is already verified by hops 1–3, so this is belt-and-suspenders.
- ✅ **Stage 5d — One-time DB reconciliation — INVESTIGATED, NOT NEEDED as originally designed.** Read-only survey of all
  6 rows: **zero real rows in the safe-backfill bucket.** The 4 hybrid rows (`380ced37`/`71a77600`/`b23eefe5`/`be69c587`)
  already resolve correctly as **hybrid** via the `isHybrid` flag TODAY; a naive `_libraryId` backfill would infer
  `ppl_6→lifting` and **FLIP them hybrid→lifting** (harmful — violates "match what `resolveProgram` already returns").
  `563271d4` is empty (`resolveProgram`: "No program set"); backfilling from the orphan `current_program=ppl_6` would invent an
  interpretation. `d3d00001` is the disposable fixture. So historical drift is **already handled correctly by the resolver
  (1–2) and prevented going forward (5a/5b)** — the stored-field inconsistency is **INERT** (no read path uses the conflicting
  fields directly). **No reconciliation run.**
  - **PRINCIPLE (future, if real drifted rows appear at scale):** reconcile ONLY where `_libraryId` is present and other fields
    disagree — clear opposite-mode fields to match the canonical `_libraryId` (the `d3d00001` shape). **NEVER infer-and-backfill
    `_libraryId` from ambiguous fields** — inference can contradict the flag-based resolution and silently change a user's
    program. Survey → bucket → bulk-reconcile only the lib-present-but-conflicting rows.
- ✅ **Catalog mode-flag correctness (7 entries) — DONE** (commit `552ea62`): `metcon_*` / `metabolic` / `hiit_strength` →
  `isConditioning:true` (now conditioning → MET 4.5→8 calorie fix); `hybrid_foundation` / `tactical_hybrid` → `isHybrid:true`.
  Verified via `deriveProgramFields` (5→conditioning, 2→hybrid, no precedence override).
- **(Separate residual — NOT part of the drift arc) Reset `startDate`/week-counter on program switch** — `profile_data.startDate`
  stays at the onboarding date → `weekNum` can be wrong post-switch; OR drive week purely from `program_current_week`. Independent
  of drift resolution; moved here for tracking.

## OPEN — pre-release / polish
- **EMOJICON SWAP — run-ability steps use stock iOS emoji; swap to the app's emojicon pack.** Small, own commit.
  **Recon done (2026-06-25):**
  - **Pack = Iconify `@iconify/react`, prefix `fluent-emoji-flat`**, rendered offline via `src/iconData.js`
    (`addCollection`, generated by `scripts/extract-icons.js`). Usage: `<Icon icon="fluent-emoji-flat:…" width height/>`
    (`ob_screens2.jsx:50/10398`). 2-pack fallback (`getFoodIcon` `iconMap.js:164`): `FOOD_ICON_MAP` (fluent-emoji-flat) →
    `TWEMOJI_FALLBACK_MAP` (twemoji) → generic — **but that's a FOOD-keyword resolver**, not a general UI-icon fallback;
    non-food icons use direct ids.
  - **Scope corrections:** (1) the **`ob_screens2.jsx` onboarding `run_*` steps have NO emoji** (use `optPill`, label+desc
    only) — nothing to swap there (adding icons = a net-add to `optPill`, bigger). (2) Only the **`RunProgramSetup`
    TapCards** use stock emoji (🏃 freq, 📏 longest; baseline 🏃/🚶/📊). (3) **Blocker:** `iconData.js` bundles **87 food
    icons only** — `person-running`/`straight-ruler`/`calendar`/`bar-chart`/`chequered-flag`/`person-walking` are NOT
    bundled, so they'd render blank offline. **Swap requires** adding the ids to `scripts/extract-icons.js` + re-running it
    to regenerate `iconData.js`, then `import { Icon }` into RunProgramSetup and pass `<Icon .../>` as the TapCard `icon`
    prop (it renders any node). i.e. RunProgramSetup-only, with the bundle-regen build step.
- _**Decided AGAINST** (don't re-flag): import-path consolidation (`supabase.js` ↔ `client.js`) — they're the same singleton via
  re-export, so it's 9 files of churn for zero behavior change. Not worth it._
- **Runna-style font pass** — Train tab control labels (HIDE ↑, SEE EXERCISES ↓) are too-heavy Archivo; match Runna
  discipline (9px floor / 11px eyebrows / spaced-caps, no `//` prefixes). User: "not now, keep on list."
- **Clinical-records / provisioning entitlement cleanup** before App Store submission — verify portal App ID + provisioning
  profile carry only what's used (binary entitlements currently clean).
- **HRV full device verification** — reads work (`ah_hrv_ok`); for the Settings-permission-sheet + real HRV data, needs an
  Apple Watch wearer + cleanest is delete/reinstall so HRV is in the initial grant.
- **HYROX calorie refinement** — `totalSec` is wall-clock incl. inter-station rest → MET 8 slightly overcounts; sum
  active-segment times instead.
- **Apple Health endgame** — prefer Apple Watch `activeEnergyBurned` reading over our estimate when present.
- **Breadcrumb keep-vs-gate** — decide keep-vs-gate for `ah_*` / `tier` / `bmr` / `plan_confirm_*` breadcrumbs before release.
  Current decision: **KEEP through development** (cheap observability on Health + onboarding-completion paths); gate or strip before App Store.
- **`markPlanBuilt` now unused** — after the atomic-write fix, the App-level `markPlanBuilt` fn + the `markPlanBuilt` prop
  on `PlanOnboarding` are dead (only caller removed). Remove as a small cleanup.
- **Onboarding-completion user-facing error** — `handleConfirm`'s catch is still `console.error`-only; on
  failure/timeout the button silently reverts. Add an honest inline/toast error ("Couldn't save — check connection, try again").
- **Minor residual direct `splitType` reads** (optional cleanup, NOT drift-causing — not the Today narrative/day surfaces):
  `morningBriefService.js:279` (weather-fetch gate `splitType.includes('run')`) and the AI workout-generation prompt
  (`ob_screens2.jsx:8169/8172/8179`, tells the model the split via `wPrefs.splitType`). Could route through `resolveProgram().displayName`.

## OPEN — big feature (was "next up" pre-Apple-Health)
- **🟡 v2 — RECIPE LIBRARY BROWSER (Kitchen "Recipes" repurpose).** Turn the Kitchen "Recipes" section into a
  **browsable / searchable / diet-filterable library of the 299 curated cooking-guide recipes** (`recipes WHERE
  user_id IS NULL`) — currently those 299 (all with authored `instructions` cooking guides, verified renderer-clean)
  are **only reachable inside a generated meal plan**, never browsable. Tap a recipe → the **existing meal-detail
  cooking-guide sheet** (already renders all shapes: multi-section headers, continuous step numbering, temp chips,
  make-ahead/storage/reheat footer — see `fuel.jsx` meal-detail overlay ~4262). Fold the current **personal "My
  Recipes"** (`recipes WHERE user_id = <you>`, via `getUserRecipes`) in as a **"Mine" filter tab**; **retire or
  demote the AI-ideas generator** (`fetchRecipes` → free-text LLM, lower-fidelity than the curated library).
  Companion to **cook-mode / batch-prep**. Recon done this session: My Recipes + AI-ideas are functional (CRUD +
  search + one-tap logging), reachable only on the Kitchen tab, and **disjoint** from the 299 presets (same table,
  `user_id`-scoped rows). Left as-is for now per decision.
- **TAB BAR REDESIGN — ✅ SHIPPED & VERIFIED on-device. FINAL DESIGN = BUMPED PILL** (commit `4cf1e6b`, **supersedes**
  the earlier `b00045b`).
  - **FINAL SHIPPED SPEC (5-tab GoClub bar, scoped via `_use5tab`; 3-tab/flag-off + base nav untouched):**
    - **Continuous off-white SVG pill** — the bar background is an inline `<svg>` (`.tab-bar-svg`) with rounded stadium
      ends + flat bottom + a **smooth center hump** that cradles the +. Path is **generated from the measured bar width**
      (`barDims` via `getBoundingClientRect`, re-measured on resize) so the ends/hump keep FIXED radii (`TAB_HUMP_RISE=30`,
      `TAB_HUMP_HALF=50`) and only the flat segments stretch → **no hump distortion at any width**. Fill
      `var(--cm-offwhite,#F4F1EC)`; warm float via SVG `drop-shadow(0 12px 26px rgba(120,8,4,.24)) …`. The bar `<div>` is a
      transparent flex container. **No `overflow:hidden`** anywhere (hump rises above, un-clipped); `position:fixed` preserved.
    - **Flush red + glyph in the hump** — bold (`font-weight:700`, 32px, `var(--cm-accent)`), raised (`top:-38`), square
      flex box + `transform-origin:center` so it **spins to × IN PLACE** (open = `translateX(-50%) rotate(135deg)`, no drift).
    - **Today centered BELOW the +** (inline tab, keeps its ref → slider highlight + `handleTabPress('today')`); the 4 fixed
      destinations **Train·Fuel·[Today/+]·Stats·You** sit inline around the center.
    - **Sliding accent pill highlight** — fixed 54×46 stadium, translateX-only (**centered on the active icon, no resize**);
      `var(--cm-accent)` (palette-aware); loop-safe `setSliderPos` bail-out + deps `[_use5tab, section]` (stopped the render-loop crash).
    - **Tap + → quick-log panel** (rises above the bar, + spins to ×): **Log Water / Log Food / Do Workout**. Emojicon
      icons (`fluent-emoji-flat` via `iconData.js`: droplet / fork-and-knife / person-lifting-weights).
  - **Iteration path (history):** off-white floating pill (`b00045b`) → dark-glass blur variant → **bumped pill** (final,
    `4cf1e6b`). Earlier v5 mocks (`-pill-big`/`-notched-plus`/`-v3`/`-bumped-pill.html`) were the design path.
  - 🔧 **OPEN follow-ups (tracked, non-blocking):**
    - **Quick-log handlers** — **Do Workout** → currently `handleTabPress('train')`; refine to today's scheduled session
      (lift/run/hybrid, no assumption). **Log Water** → currently routes to Fuel; wire a **direct water quick-add**. (Log Food → Fuel is fine.)
    - **Color-swap polish** — the warm red-tinted hump shadow + (legacy) notch-border assume a red palette; eyeball on
      non-red accents (blue/pink/etc.) once. Non-blocking.
  - 💤 **DROPPED — swipe-swap (2b):** the + is now **always visible** in the hump (with Today inline below), so the
    Today⇄+ swap no longer applies. (A vertical swipe on the center still toggles the quick-log panel.)

- **PROGRESS TAB redesign** — large **multi-session epic** (was "next up" pre-Apple-Health; merged in from the stale Drive doc
  so this file is complete). Reskin the Progress tab from the OLD dark theme (`#000`, `var(--accent)`, DM Mono `//` eyebrows) to
  the red/white `--cm-*` system, sub-tab by sub-tab, plus the approved **rolodex section-selector** interaction.
  - **Target (be precise):** `ProgressSection` (`ob_screens2.jsx:~9180`), mounted at `{section==="progress"}` (~`:10684`).
    **NOT** the `sections.jsx` `trainScreen==="progress"` block — that's a separate Train sub-screen, easy to confuse.
  - **Inventory:** **5 sub-tabs** — overview / strength / nutrition / recovery / running — **~30 cards**, **14+ custom SVG/canvas
    charts**, all still on the old dark theme.
  - **Rolodex section-selector (approved interaction):** tap the section name → a wheel-scrub scrubs sub-tabs live
    (prefetch-backed), reusing the **scroll-snap wheel picker** — same component family (`Rolodex`/`StackPicker`, `components.jsx`)
    as the RunProgramSetup time-input wheels we just shipped.
  - **Foundation already done:** `getUserMode` 5-tabs, weight logging, prefetch.

- **PROGRAMMING ENGINE AUDIT — ensure every program is coach-grade optimized** — large, **foundational OWN PROJECT**
  (post the hybrid dayPlan quick-fix). This is the _"we are the best / very detailed"_ differentiator. Scope:
  - **MUSCLE COVERAGE:** every program hits all major groups across the week/mesocycle, down to **head-level**
    (3 triceps heads, 3 delt heads, etc.) — no gaps.
  - **VOLUME / SETS / REPS / REST:** correct per goal — hypertrophy (8–12 reps, 60–90s rest, higher volume),
    strength (3–5 reps, 3–5min rest), endurance, etc. **Calculated, not arbitrary.**
  - **GOAL-DRIVEN PARAMETERS:** an onboarding _"what's your goal"_ question (build muscle / strength / etc.) drives
    sets/reps/rest adaptation per program. **Evidence-based defaults (decision: option 2).**
  - **STYLE-AUTHENTIC PROGRAMS:** Golden Era / signature programs stay **FAITHFUL** to the original routines (the greats —
    Arnold/Zane/etc.), **NOT** generic-ized into default hypertrophy. The audit respects program identity.
  - **DOMS / RECOVERY-AWARE PLACEMENT:** day sequencing avoids stacking same-muscle stress back-to-back; recovery between
    hard sessions; muscle-map-driven placement.
  - **METHOD:** audit what exists first **(decision: option 3)** → define the standard → encode. Applies **system-wide**,
    including re-touching the hybrid dayPlan generator built in the quick fix.
  - **FLAG (from Pass 2 recon) — `liftFocus` enum granularity.** The dayPlan `liftFocus` is a 3-value enum
    (`heavy_lower|full|upper`), so Push AND Pull both collapse to `"upper"`. Fine NOW (every consumer reads it only as
    `=== 'heavy_lower'`; Push/Pull/Legs workout content comes from `splitType`+cycle, not `liftFocus`). BUT if the audit's
    **head-level muscle coverage** needs per-day push/pull/legs granularity encoded IN the dayPlan, the enum may need
    widening. Not a current bug — flagged for the audit.
  - 🔴 **FLAGSHIP DEFECT — HYBRID LIFT CONTENT ↔ dayPlan DISCONNECT** (real defect, pre-existing, **NOT a Pass-2
    regression**). Hybrid lift-day CONTENT comes from a **static template** (`getTodayHybridWorkout` →
    `HYBRID_PROGRAMS[template].weekly_structure`, keyed by **DAY NAME**, lift days hardcoded e.g. Mon/Wed/Fri) and
    **IGNORES the user's picked dayPlan entirely**. When picked lift days ≠ template's fixed days, content is wrong:
    confirmed repro (picks Mon/Tue/Wed lift) → Mon=Push ✓, **Tue=Easy Run ✗** (run on a lift day), **Wed=Pull ✗** (Pull
    on the Legs day), and **Legs (template Fri) NEVER delivered** (user didn't pick Fri) → a whole muscle group dropped.
    **THREE disconnected representations** of each lift day: (1) dayPlan `liftFocus` [PPL cycle, read only as
    `===heavy_lower` for DOMS], (2) WeekStrip label [`autoFocus`→`SPLIT_CYCLES`, no hybrid key → "Full Body" for all],
    (3) content [static template by day name]. None driven by the user's picks; none agree. Pass 2 wired
    dayPlan→run-placement+DOMS but lift CONTENT was left on the legacy static template (`sections.jsx:2667`
    "byte-for-byte unchanged"). **FIX = the AUDIT's core job:** drive per-day lift content from the cycle/dayPlan
    (correct body part per picked day, no dropped muscle groups), unify the 3 representations to one source. **This is
    the audit's flagship concrete example.**

  - **📋 PHASE 0 RECON MAP (2026-06-24) — the audit's factual foundation. Next session DESIGNS from this; do not re-derive.**
    Read-only map of how content flows TODAY. Four parts:

    **(1) CONTENT SOURCES — per program type.** Central dispatch: every day routes through `resolveProgram(wPrefs,
    profile).mode` (`programResolver.js:132`; modes `hybrid-hyrox|hyrox|hybrid|running|conditioning|lifting`). Two
    consumers read it: Train tab (`sections.jsx:2535`, per-day `if/else` chain `:2588–2676`) and Today tab
    (`ob_screens2.jsx:7858`, mirrors Train).

    | Type | Source | Entry point | Class | Keyed by |
    |---|---|---|---|---|
    | Pure lifting | `PROGRAMS_BY_DAYS[days].splits[splitType].workouts[dayKey]` | `getWorkoutForDay()` `programs.js:2598` (call `sections.jsx:2589`) | Static template + runtime overlay (progression/SKILL_OVERRIDES/GVT/soreness) | `splitType`→`selectDayKey()` `:2589`→`_sessionIndex()` `:2561` = cycle index anchored on `program_start_date` |
    | Pure run | run engine `generateRunWeek()` `runEngine.js:564` | `getTodayRunWorkout()` `running_programs.js:1618`→`getRunWeek()` `:1581` (call `sections.jsx:2611`) | Generator | day name in generated week (`:1630`) |
    | Hybrid lift days | `HYBRID_PROGRAMS[template].weekly_structure` | `getTodayHybridWorkout()` `running_programs.js:1658` (call `sections.jsx:2670`) | Static template | **DAY NAME hardcoded** (flagship defect) |
    | Hybrid run days | run engine (same as pure run) | `getTodayRunWorkout()` (call `sections.jsx:2651`) | Generator | `deriveDayModality()` `running_programs.js:1417` + `dayPlan` |

    | Conditioning/metcon | `PROGRAMS_BY_DAYS` conditioning split keys (e.g. `programs.js:471`) | `getWorkoutForDay()` — mode collapsed conditioning→lifting at `sections.jsx:2536` | Static template (lifting path) | same cycle-index walk |

    Catalog→source: `PROGRAM_LIBRARY` (`programs.js:2455`) via flags in `deriveProgramFields` (`programResolver.js:57`):
    no-flag→lifting; `isConditioning`→conditioning(→lifting); `isRun`→run engine; `isHyrox`→HYROX; `isHybrid`→
    HYBRID_PROGRAMS+run engine; `isHybrid+isHyrox`→`getTodayHybridWorkout("Hyrox Hybrid")`. **Dead/orphaned content
    (exported, zero daily-dispatch consumers):** `CONDITIONING_PROGRAMS` (`programs.js:2373`), `STRONGLIFTS_5x5` (`:2433`;
    live SL5x5 is the in-`PROGRAMS_BY_DAYS` split), `GLUTE_PROGRAMS` (`:1543`; picker-UI only). **Catalog gap:**
    `hybrid_foundation`/`tactical_hybrid` have NO matching `HYBRID_PROGRAMS` template (only 4 templates exist there).

    **(2) MUSCLE COVERAGE — static lifting content is largely COACH-GRADE (so the audit is mostly "connect content to
    dayPlan," NOT "rebuild content").** Core splits (6-day PPL×2, 5-day ULPPL, Bro Split, Arnold) hit all 3 delt heads
    (lateral+face pull+rear-delt fly), triceps long/lateral, biceps long/short/brachialis, quads/hams/calves. Exercise
    schema: `{name,sets,reps,notes,primary}`. Golden-Era/signature programs EXIST and are author-faithful: Arnold Split
    (`programs.js:1336`), Platz Volume (`:995`), HIT/Mentzer (`:444`), Nubret/Weider/Reg Park/GVT (no "Zane"). Full
    novice/advanced arrays via `SKILL_OVERRIDES`. **Two content-level gaps (not rebuilds):** (a) NO structured
    `rest`/`tempo`/`RIR` field anywhere — rest only as prose in some `notes`; (b) THREE incompatible schemas —
    `PROGRAMS_BY_DAYS`/`GLUTE_PROGRAMS` use `workouts{day:[...]}`, PREGNANCY/POSTPARTUM use flat `exercises[]`,
    `HYBRID_PROGRAMS` (running file) stores lift days as **free-text `description` strings** ("Deadlift 4×3-5, Barbell
    Row 4×4-6…"), not arrays. Minor selection gaps: standard PPL/Upper-Lower no direct hip-thrust; PHUL Power Upper +
    2-day Full Body lack a dedicated rear-delt move.

    **(3) GOOD vs BROKEN.** WORKS AS-IS: **Pure lifting definitively does NOT share the hybrid disconnect** — title +
    content use the SAME `_sessionIndex` cycle-walk with matching args (content `getWorkoutForDay`/`selectDayKey`
    `programs.js:2598/2589`; title `selectDayKey`+`baseName` `NativeApp.jsx:937–945`; brief `morningBriefService.js:60`);
    pick any N days → cycle advances correctly, no dropped day (the Stage-6 unification). Pure run consistent (title +
    content both from generated `runWeek`). Conditioning inherits lifting's correct path. Hybrid run days route through
    the engine + respect dayPlan. BROKEN/GAPS: 🔴 hybrid lift-day content↔dayPlan disconnect (`getTodayHybridWorkout`
    `running_programs.js:1658` matches by day name, ignores `dayPlan`); three disconnected hybrid lift-day reps disagree
    (`liftFocus` enum `ob_screens2.jsx:4748`; WeekStrip `autoFocus`→`SPLIT_CYCLES` has no hybrid key→"Full Body"
    `components.jsx:187/444`; static day-name content); **HYROX undefined-weeks gap** — `weeks_detail` defines only a few
    weeks (12-week = 1,4,8,10,12), `getTodayHyroxWorkout` returns `null` otherwise → "No Program Selected"
    (`sections.jsx:4207`) on real training days; hybrid/HYROX have NO week-to-week progression engine (same static
    structure every week; overload text-only).

    **(4) STANDARDS GAP (adopt-list vs today).**
    | Standard | Status | Evidence |
    |---|---|---|
    | Volume landmarks MEV→MRV + auto-deload | PARTIAL | MEV/MAV/MRV are display-only analytics (`MuscleVolumeChart.jsx:49–89`), `OPTIMAL_SETS` zones (`recoveryService.js:27`); deload real but signal-based fixed 50% cut (`deloadService.js:17`), NOT a weekly ramp; not wired to generation |
    | Stimulus-to-Fatigue-Ratio selection | GREENFIELD | zero hits; `exerciseMuscleMap.js` has only primary/secondary + prose, no SFR scores |
    | Frequency per experience level | PARTIAL | per-SESSION sets/reps/rest/RPE by goal×level wired (`data/prescription.js:18`, `getPrescription` `:123`, used `sections.jsx:2713`)+`SKILL_OVERRIDES`; training age `progressionService.js:130`. Per-MUSCLE weekly frequency by level = greenfield |
    | Emphasis / maintain / ignore | PARTIAL | `weakPoints` collected (`onboarding.jsx:1681`), used only to SORT priority exercises (`sections.jsx:2741`, `ait.js:109`); no extra sets/freq, no maintain/ignore tiers, no reallocation |
    | Feedback-driven weekly volume adj. | PARTIAL | single GLOBAL LLM `volumeAdjustment` multiplier (`adaptiveAnalysisService.js:95`→`adaptiveSessionService.js:78`), not per-muscle set add/cut |

    **WIRED BASELINE that already EXISTS (audit does NOT rebuild this) — app is a daily readiness/recovery
    autoregulation system, not an RP mesocycle system:** multi-signal readiness modifier (`recoveryService.js:218`),
    per-lift autoregulated progression + plateau detect (`progressionService.js:45/105`), personalized DOMS learning
    (`domsLearningService.js`), session-spacing guards (`adaptiveSessionService.js:6`), run-engine DOMS-aware lift
    placement (`runEngine.js:158`), strength-sport phase periodization (`strengthPeriodisationService.js`), on-the-fly
    AI session adaptation (`sections.jsx:949`).

    **⚠️ SETS/REPS TWO-SOURCE RECONCILIATION NOTE:** sets/reps have TWO sources — the static templates' own `sets/reps`
    in `PROGRAMS_BY_DAYS`, AND the `getPrescription` goal×level scheme applied at `sections.jsx:2713`. How they interact
    (override vs merge) must be confirmed when the audit defines the volume standard.

  - **✅ PHASE 1 DESIGN DECISION (SETTLED 2026-06-24) — designed from the Phase 0/1 recon above.**

    **UNIFIED EXERCISE SCHEMA:** extend the existing 5-field lifting object `{name, sets, reps, notes, primary}` with
    structured fields `{rest:Number(sec), tempo:String|null, rir:Number|null, secondary:[String]|null}`. Constraints
    from recon: (1) `name` is the universal join key across ~15 consumers + DB — **NEVER reformatted**; (2) new fields
    are generation/render-time only — **NOT persisted** (`finishWorkout` `ob_screens2.jsx:8334` stores only `name` +
    per-set `{weight,reps,done}`), so **NON-BREAKING, no `workout_logs` migration**; (3) the prescription overlay
    (`getPrescription` `data/prescription.js:123`) already populates sets/reps/rest and currently **DROPS `rpe`** — the
    new `rir` field is where dropped `rpe` goes.

    **SETS/REPS RECONCILIATION (Phase 2 — mostly already done in code):** the live behavior is
    **prescription-overrides-static** (`sections.jsx:2712`, when `trainingGoal` set). Phase 2 shrinks to: document the
    rule + stop dropping `rpe`→`rir`. **Not a rebuild.**

    **HYBRID LIFT CONTENT (Option 3 — the flagship fix, CONFIRMED FEASIBLE):** hybrid lift days route to
    `getWorkoutForDay` (pure-lifting path) indexed by dayPlan cycle position, **ABANDONING** the separate
    `HYBRID_PROGRAMS` free-text lift content.
    - **Mechanism:** stop DISCARDING the cycle label in `buildHybridDayPlan` (`running_programs.js:1396` — `cyc[i%len]`
      is computed then collapsed to the enum); widen `dayPlan` to carry it (also serves the `liftFocus`-granularity flag
      + head-level muscle work). Hybrid lift day's ordinal position `k` → `getWorkoutForDay(splitType =
      HYBRID_TEMPLATE_CYCLES[template], dayIndex = k, omit schedule/startDate for positional indexing)`.
    - **Coverage:** all 5 mapped templates have pure-lifting content (PPL exact `programs.js:63`, U/L positional
      `programs.js:288`), **ZERO new authoring**. Hyrox Hybrid excluded (own path).
    - **Blast radius:** `sections.jsx:2669-2670` only; run days untouched. `getSkillVariant` is **DEAD code** (never
      called) so hybrid `skill_variants` are dead data — removal loses nothing rendered. `HYBRID_PROGRAMS` **NARROWS**
      (keeps `nutritionBridge`, `raceSimulation`, run-day desc, Hyrox Hybrid); only the 5 templates' lift-day
      `weekly_structure` becomes unused.
    - **RESULT:** fixes flagship defect at root (no divorced hybrid content), hybrid inherits coach-grade coverage
      automatically, unifies the 3 disconnected representations, collapses the schema question.
    - **BUILD SEQUENCE:**
      - ✅ **1a — Option 3 hybrid lift reroute — DONE & committed (`fc8f7a5`), VERIFIED on-device** (DB-confirmed:
        `d3d00001` Wed→k=2→Legs→Barbell Squat, 5 exercises; Mon=Push/Tue=Pull deterministic). Adds `cycleLabel` to
        dayPlan (additive), shared `buildLiftingPrescription` helper (pure-lifting byte-identical), widens 3 array guards.
        Temp `hybrid_lift_route` breadcrumb added then reverted (clean tree hash-matched the pre-breadcrumb build).
      - ✅ **1c — label-layer fix — committed (`11edcbc`), built & deployed (`NativeApp-ef2c6bec`); on-device label
        verification pending.** `dayFocus` build (`NativeApp.jsx:937`) labels hybrid lift days from `cycleLabel`
        (post-1a) or ordinal fallback (pre-1a dayPlans, same k + cycle map as content) → week strip PUSH/PULL/LEGS +
        day-header descriptor match content. Additive + hybrid-gated; pure-lifting unchanged (byte-identical `selectDayKey`
        path). Fixes the WeekStrip "UPPER" + the "balanced push/pull on a Legs day" header.
      - ⬜ **1b — schema extension** (rest/tempo/rir/secondary) — NEXT; recon done (Phase 1 design decision above).

- **RUN ENGINE VOLUME MODEL** — large, **foundational OWN PROJECT** (sibling to the Programming Engine Audit). The
  run engine has sophisticated DOMS/recovery PLACEMENT (`runEngine.js` `generateRunWeek`) but **no volume model**. THREE
  CONFIRMED DEFECTS (found on-device, hybrid 5-day, validated against Runna):
  1. **No weekly mileage model** — a beginner's plan opens at ~12 mi (6+6) week 1, with no starting-volume calc from
     fitness level and no week-over-week ramp. (Runna: starting weekly mileage set from fitness, builds gradually,
     deloads every 3-5 weeks.)
  2. **Run types not differentiated by distance** — long run AND easy run both 6 mi (should differ: easy = most of weekly
     volume, conversational, shorter; long = the weekly distance peak; plus tempo/intervals as distinct hard sessions).
     Runna: 80/20 easy/hard, 4 long-run subtypes, easy/hard/long distances tuned independently.
  3. **No week-over-week progression or deloads** in the run plan (static distances every week).
  - **MODEL TO BUILD (Runna-informed):** onboarding inputs → starting weekly mileage → distribute across run types by
    distance+pace (80/20) → progress weekly → deload every 3-5 weeks.
  - **SOURCE OF TRUTH:** Emiliano providing Runna's full onboarding breakdown (questions + answer choices) as the design
    spec foundation — the input→volume mapping the public pages don't reveal. **Designed from the Runna breakdown next.**
  - **RELATED:** the long-run-day DOMS veto (long run moved Sat→Sun for hybrid) — revisit whether the long run should
    ANCHOR and the LIFT move instead, as part of this model + the hybrid interaction. (Cross-refs the TRANSPARENT
    RECOVERY-AWARE LONG RUN item below.)
  - **📐 DESIGN SPEC (from Runna onboarding breakdown + support-doc mechanism, cross-verified):**

    **INPUT MODEL (what onboarding must collect to drive volume):**
    - **Running ABILITY = master volume input.** Tiers DEFINED BY SINGLE-RUN CAPABILITY (Runna's): Beginner = 5k
      continuous <60min; Intermediate = regularly ≥5k unstructured; Advanced = regularly ≥10k + some structure; Elite =
      regularly HM+. Ability → starting weekly mileage AND per-workout distances (NOT total-weekly — single-run capability).
    - **BEGINNER GUARDRAIL (the 'beginner at 12mi' fix):** if user CAN'T run 5k continuous → route to run-walk intervals
      plan (distinct type, 2-4 days), NOT a mileage plan. A true beginner gets intervals, not miles.
    - **Goal** (race/distance/start/return/improve/general/functional/post-injury/post-race) → plan type + race-anchoring.
    - **Injury history** (rarely / minor-past / frequent-recent) → volume conservatism + recovery.
    - **DOB, gender** → physiological adjustment. **Estimated race time** → pace zones (HAVE: `vdotFromRaceTime`).
    - **Days/week** (2-4 new, more experienced) → session split. **Days + long-run day** → placement. **Plan length**
      (7-26wk/custom) → ramp slope + deload count. **Miles/km** → units.

    **VOLUME MODEL (the 4 builds):**
    1. ability → starting weekly mileage + max single-run distance (fixes beginner-at-12mi).
    2. weekly mileage → distribute across run TYPES by distinct distance+pace, 80/20 easy/hard: easy = bulk of
       volume/shorter/conversational, LONG = weekly distance PEAK, tempo/intervals = the 20% hard. NEVER same distance
       (fixes long=easy bug).
    3. weekly progression: long run + weekly volume ramp gradually, slope from plan length × ability.
    4. deload every 3-5 weeks: drop weekly mileage (HAVE `deloadService` — signal-based; wire into the run calendar).

    **HYBRID INTERACTION:** the run volume model must account for lift-day fatigue (the existing DOMS veto) — and revisit
    whether long run anchors and the LIFT moves instead (cross-ref Transparent Recovery-Aware Long Run).
    **Cross-verified:** Runna support 'Adjusting Your Running Ability' (ability underpins mileage + workout distances);
    marketing (80/20, progressive long runs, deloads 3-5wk).
  - **🔎 PHASE 0 RECON — MAJOR CORRECTION (2026-06-24): the volume model EXISTS and is wired** (`runEngine.js`:
    `START_BANDS`, `getStartingVolume`, `buildVolumeProgression` w/ 10% ramp + down-weeks every 3-4 + taper, 80/20
    distribution in `buildSessions` w/ long-run-longest invariant; `getRunWeek`→`generateRunWeek` is the live source for
    pure-run AND hybrid run days). **The 3 "defects" are INPUT/WIRING/VISIBILITY, not a missing model.**
    - **ROOT (Q4): NO running-specific ability tier.** `experience = profile.skill_level || wPrefs.liftExp ||
      'intermediate'` (`buildRunEngineInputs:1535`), and `skill_level` is set FROM `liftExp` (`NativeApp.jsx:631`). So
      **run ability = LIFTING experience** → a beginner runner classified 'intermediate' → `START_BANDS.intermediate`
      (~20mi) not beginner (12) → the '12mi'/'6+6' symptom. The volume math is correct; it's fed the wrong ability.
    - **THE FIXES (re-sized — much smaller than "build a volume model"):**
      - **(a) RUNNING-SPECIFIC ABILITY INPUT** (core — root of #1 + most of #2): a run ability tier decoupled from
        `liftExp`, derived like Runna from CURRENT single-run capability / current race time (Beginner=5k continuous
        <60min, Intermediate=regularly ≥5k unstructured, Advanced=≥10k+structure, Elite=HM+). Image-1 screenshot =
        Runna's 'current 5k/10k/HM/M time' input. Feed this to `getStartingVolume`'s `exp` instead of `liftExp`.
      - **(b) 'long==easy' collapse:** caps+rounding at the inflated volume (`easyDist` hits beginner cap 6,
        `longRunDist` rounds ~6, invariant raises long to match). Largely DISSOLVES once (a) feeds the correct lower
        beginner volume; may need cap/fraction tuning in `buildSessions`.
      - ✅ **(c) SURFACE WEEKLY MILEAGE — SHIPPED & VERIFIED** (commit `a93e116`). `weeklyVolumeMi` (already on
        `runWeek`/`todayPrescription`) now renders as a **"WEEKLY · X MI" summary row** under Sunday in the THIS WEEK
        list (`WeekStrip` `weeklyMi` prop). Display-only; engine untouched.
      - ✅ **RUN PACE ACCURACY (VDOT) — SHIPPED & VERIFIED** (commit `a93e116`). `getPacesFromTime` (`runningPaces.js`)
        now delegates to the validated **Daniels VDOT engine** (`paceService.js` `vdotFromRaceTime` + `trainingPaces`)
        instead of flat 5K-pace multipliers → fixes the tempo overshoot (39:36 5K: tempo 13:48→**13:05**, easy 16:23,
        interval 12:41), one source of truth. **NaN guard:** robust parser (number / MM:SS / H:MM:SS / numeric → seconds,
        else null → paces block hides). No engine/distribution change (fix b untouched).
        - 🧹 **FOLLOW-UP — `current5KTime` storage inconsistency:** `wprefs.current5KTime` = `"39:36"` (STRING, MM:SS)
          while `profile_data.current5KTime` = `"2400"` (number, seconds) — **different formats AND different values**
          (39:36 vs 40:00). The new parser tolerates both, but **writers should normalise to ONE format + ONE source of
          truth** (other readers like `ob_screens2:8196` assume the MM:SS string). Tracked, non-blocking.
        - 🟡 **DECISION — beginner easy-pace floor:** pure Daniels easy/long are intentionally **slow at low VDOT**
          (VDOT 22: easy 16:23 / long 16:57). **Shipped as-is (correct per the model).** Revisit whether a beginner
          wants an easy-pace **floor** as a deliberate product tweak (faster than Daniels for very low fitness).
      - **(d) TRUE-BEGINNER run-walk routing** (Runna guardrail): `isTrueBeginner` flag exists (`buildSessions`:
        `currentRunsPerWeek===0 || longestRunMi≤1`) but only adds notes — no distinct run-walk plan. Route non-runners
        to intervals, not a mileage plan.
      - **(e) PROGRESSION 'looks static'** = visibility (UI shows today only) + possibly `weekInPlan` anchor
        (`runPlanStart`) being off. Verify the anchor; surface the multi-week arc.
    - **ARCHITECTURAL (separable, largest): long-run ANCHOR (#3/Q5)** — invert the lift-then-run placement (lifts
      placed first to `dayPlan`, run engine reads `heavyLowerDays` as immutable; long run flexes around fixed lifts).
      To anchor long run + move the lift: either move DOMS-adjacency reasoning into `buildHybridDayPlan` (write-time) or
      add a reconciliation pass. Feasible, not a flag — own phase.
    - **Cross-verified:** Runna support 'Adjusting Running Ability' + Image-1 onboarding screenshot.
  - ✅ **PHASE 1 — DONE & VERIFIED, committed `7a9595b`** (bundle `NativeApp-7f133c92`).
    - **Engine:** `deriveRunAbility({longestRunMi,currentRunsPerWeek,seconds5K})` (`runEngine.js`, beside
      `getStartingVolume`) returns exactly `{beginner|intermediate|advanced}` (thresholds on real onboarding bucket
      edges: beginner = `rpw===0` or `longestRunMi≤2`; advanced = `longestRunMi≥8` or `rpw≥3 && seconds5K≤1500`;
      else intermediate). `:1538` repoint: `experience = wPrefs.runAbility || deriveRunAbility(...) || 'intermediate'`
      (was `skill_level||liftExp||'intermediate'`). **Lifting path untouched** — only this one running consumer changed.
    - **Onboarding collection:** pure-run made REQUIRED (removed `run_5k` skip + `run_longest` non-HM skip; `run_frequency`
      was already required); **hybrid** now collects them too (`run_5k`/`run_frequency`/`run_longest` added to the hybrid
      `_stepSeq` after `hyb_split`; full reuse of existing step components); the 3 write gates widened
      `focus==="run"` → `(focus==="run"||focus==="hybrid")`. Lifting onboarding never sees these.
    - _(Temp `run_ability` breadcrumb used for verification — reverted post-verify.)_
  - ✅ **PHASE 2 — DONE & VERIFIED, committed `52a12ef`** (switch path, Option X). RunProgramSetup `Step3Running` collects
    frequency+longest (`TapCard`, required) + reuses the existing baseline 5K (`actualDist==='5k' ? baselineSecs :
    proj.fiveK`); both `saveRunProfile` payloads carry the 3 fields; `handleCantRun` writes beginner `0/1`. `doActualSwitch`
    threads `_freshRun.{currentRunsPerWeek,longestRunMi,current5KTime}` into `activateProgramMode`, which syncs them to the
    engine-read wPrefs fields (mirrors the `longRunDay` sync at `ProgramLibrary.jsx:85`). **All 3 entry points now write
    the same wPrefs ability fields → no fourth path.** Verified on-device: switch-into-hybrid beginner inputs →
    `derivedAbility:"beginner"`, `startVol` 2.7 (was always intermediate/18 on switch).
    - 🧹 **STALE COMMENT (tiny follow-up):** the `running_programs.js` repoint comment still says "switch-in users resolve
      intermediate until Phase 2" — now only true for **legacy null-data users who never re-switch**; update wording.
  - ✅ **fix (b) — long==easy collapse at LOW volume — SHIPPED & VERIFIED** (commit `2cca655`). Long-run-longest invariant
    `< → <=` with `roundDist(maxOther+0.25)` (`runEngine.js`) so long stays strictly > easy at low volume. **DB-confirmed:**
    beginner 2.7 mi/wk now **long 1.5 > easy 1.25** (was 1.25 = 1.25), three consistent `run_ability` breadcrumb fires.
    Fires only on tie/inversion (low volume); zero distortion at normal volumes.

- **TRANSPARENT RECOVERY-AWARE LONG RUN** (feeds the Programming Engine Audit's DOMS/recovery-placement work).
  The DOMS/recovery model already **EXISTS and is sophisticated** (`runEngine.js` `generateRunWeek`: Sat>Sun preference,
  never-adjacent-to-heavy-legs via `daysAdjacent`, personalized DOMS windows from `domsProfile.peakHours`,
  `recoveryCapacity` modulation; post-Pass-2 it also reasons about hybrid heavy-lower days, fed from the dayPlan via
  `deriveDayModality.heavyLowerDays` → `liftingLoad`). **What's MISSING is the transparent/collaborative UX layer:**
  (1) when the user's `longRunDay` pick is recovery-suboptimal, **SHOW the engine's reasoning** (_"Wednesday puts your
  long run the day after heavy legs — Saturday gives 48h recovery"_); (2) **RECOMMEND** the optimal day but let the user
  keep their pick; (3) **re-flow** the week's recovery around whatever they choose. Today the user-pick reconciliation
  (`getRunWeek` :1607) is a **blind conditional swap** with no DOMS reasoning and no messaging. = surface + wire the
  existing engine reasoning + a messaging layer, **NOT** build the model. Belongs with the audit's recovery-placement work.
_Tracked, not scheduled. Each is design-before-build; several need competitor/market research before a model is chosen._

- **SESSION TYPES (user opt-in, per-day/cadence placement)** — let users add advanced session types and place them
  on specific days / cadences. **Design model TBD via market research.**
  - _Endurance:_ brick workouts, two-a-days (AM/PM), time-trial / benchmark tests, fartlek/tempo as tagged types.
  - _Strength:_ EMOM/AMRAP, drop sets / supersets, max-effort testing days, deload as a surfaced session type.
  - **ASSIGNMENT MODEL:** per-day/cadence placement (user picks types + WHERE — e.g. brick Sat, two-a-days Tue/Thu,
    benchmark every 4wk), **NOT** a global on/off. Design via competitor research first.

- **ADAPT NOW (unified smart-adjust button)** — bring back as ONE button that absorbs all in-the-moment adjustments.
  **Keep in mind during ALL core work** (design while building core so the engine can support it):
  - travel → no-gym bodyweight swap; injury/tweak → _"what's bothering you?"_ → avoid loading it; low energy / poor sleep
    → lighter, HRV-driven; time-crunch → condensed; equipment-unavailable → substitute.

- **EXTRAS (tracked):** injury/niggle profiles (persistent); exercise swaps/preferences **[NOTE: partially EXISTS —
  audit what's there first]**; equipment profiles; progressive overload + PR detection; session time estimates.

- **COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE (2026 market research):**
  - **RP Strength** = evidence-based hypertrophy gold standard, BUT: hypertrophy-only, dated UI, limited
    analytics/customization, $25–35/mo, 2.8 Trustpilot. **Mesostrength / Alpha Progression** = cheaper challengers.
  - **THE GAP (our wedge):** 2026 reviews say the biggest unmet need is **hybrid** — people want muscle AND
    running/conditioning, but pure-hypertrophy apps _"treat cardio as an afterthought, program leg day without knowing
    you ran 8km yesterday."_ That **IS** Coach Macro's thesis.
  - **OUR DIFFERENTIATORS:** hybrid (lift+run+nutrition) engine; Design-Award UI (vs their dated look); objective +
    subjective auto-regulation (HRV + feedback, vs their subjective-only); deep analytics / Progress redesign;
    fatigue-aware cross-modal programming.
  - **ADOPT (validated best-practices → feed the PROGRAMMING ENGINE AUDIT):** volume landmarks MEV→MRV across the
    mesocycle w/ auto-deload; stimulus-to-fatigue-ratio exercise selection; frequency per experience level; muscle
    emphasis / maintain / ignore (RP's _"Meso Builder"_); feedback-driven weekly volume adjustment.
  - **Keep watching:** RP Strength, Mesostrength, Alpha Progression, Hevy (UX/social leader), Fitbod, STRNDR.

## 🔵 V2 BACKLOG — COACHING CONTENT (author `exercise_coaching` rows)
_Logged 2026-07-06. The coaching-pill normalization fix (`_normKey` + `_COACH_ALIAS`, uncommitted in `sections.jsx`, rides with the set-view commit) resolves generator name variants against the **103 seeded** `exercise_coaching` names via spelling/plural/synonym/equipment-generic + reviewed Tier-3 map-to-closest. After that, **38 real generator exercises have NO seeded row and NO safe closest** — left deliberately uncovered (pill correctly absent) rather than mapped to misleading coaching. A dev-only `console.warn('[coaching] no row for exercise:', name, '→ key:', ...)` surfaces these live. **V2 task = author beginner/intermediate/advanced rows (or rule "leave forever") for these 38:**_

- **Genuine authoring candidates (distinct movement, no good proxy):** Air Squat, Bodyweight Squat, Front Raise, Pallof Press, Banded Pallof Press, Cable Pull Through, Banded Pull Through, Plank, Side Plank, Copenhagen Plank, Hollow Body Hold, Pigeon Pose Hold, Tricep Kickback, Cable Tricep Kickback, Banded Chest Press, and the tricep-emphasis push-up variants **Diamond Push Up / Close Grip Push Up / Tricep Push Up / Decline Push Up** (ruled LEAVE — generic Push-Up cues miss the point).
- **Lunge / step-up family (ambiguous which seeded variant):** Lunge, Weighted Lunge, Sandbag Lunge, Curtsy Lunge, Lateral Lunge to Curtsy, Step Up.
- **Plyometric / pulse / combo / non-lift (likely LEAVE-forever):** Jump Squat, Jump Squats, Banded Squat Jump, Sumo Squat with Pulse, Hip Thrust Pulse, Banded Squat to Pulse, Goblet Squat to Press, Dumbbell Romanian Deadlift to Row, Burpee Broad Jump, Push Press, "Pull Up / Lat Pulldown" (combo label), Sled Pull, Medicine Ball Throw.
- _(3 originally-flagged items were MAPPED instead, not backlogged: Face Pull with Band→Band Face Pull, Face Pull or Band Pull-Apart→Face Pull, Push Up Progression→Push Up.)_

## WORKING RULES
- **Recon-first:** STEP 0 = quote the exact current code/state before any edit; confirm assumptions against the real files (don't act on a stale premise — surface mismatches).
- **Small, targeted edits:** minimal `str_replace`-style changes; compile-check (`esbuild` for JS, generic-destination `xcodebuild` for native) before proposing a build.
- **Instrumentation over guessing:** when behavior is unclear, add fire-and-forget `analytics_events` breadcrumbs (readable via Supabase MCP — we cannot read the WKWebView console over cable) rather than theorize.
- **Never destructive DB writes without explicit ask;** prefer read-only inspection (`list_tables`, `get_logs`, `execute_sql` SELECT).
- **Git:** commit only when asked; branch `goclub-redesign`; commit author uses the GitHub no-reply email (avoids GH007); end commit messages with the Claude co-author trailer.
- **Build hygiene:** always the `rm -rf ios/App/App/public` prefix; native plugin changes live in the `patches/` file (regenerate with `npx patch-package @perfood/capacitor-healthkit`); `postinstall: patch-package` reapplies on install.
